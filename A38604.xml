         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the great things of the Chriſtians
Law. They miſtake Religion, who
underſtand it to direct only in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly

make Honeſt Men, and while the
Decalogue is within the compaſs of
our Creed, and we believe both
Tables of Gods law to contain our
Morall duty, the ſcope of one muſt be (rightly underſtood)
ever to guide our outward, morall, civil converſation. It is
an age now much treating of Religion, and hard to ſuppoſe
that any of thoſe who are moſt forward would (willingly
and knowingly) leave out one half; leading men to God
with neglect of Men, and trampling down all Civil righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
in order to Heavenly: This makes it the more
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58798:6"/>
needfully conſiderable what that Righteouſneſs is, that we
may not ſeem to love God with neglect of our Neighbour,
or in zeal of Religion to permit our ſelves unjuſt: but ſo to
make our pilgrimage through this world, that we leave the
reputation of Honeſt men behinde us, and ſo to paſs through
things temporall, that finally we loſe not the things eternall.

It being left to our Autumn of the world, only to
reap the harveſt of their rich piety, who lived and made very
coſtly ſeed-times before us, and ſerve God cheap enough at
their coſt and charges: They having given ſo much from
themſelves, and all the world; that we need only iſſue out
their bounty, and in what we contribute or give forth to
Chriſtian Worſhip, are not ſo much liberall as righteous; nor
doe we give, but pay. This is ſo, I know it to be ſo, I was
glad to finde it ſo: Others gifts have made it, and great is the
advantage that comes hereby to Religion and us, from thoſe
are now at reſt from their Labours, and their works follow
them. I confeſſe, I could not but all along wiſh ſo great a
work better done; and ſenſibly complain of infirmities all
along: that <hi>impar congreſſus</hi> between undertaking and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance

Beſide that I often wiſhed I had been able but to bring in
what my ſelf ſaw the Argument did afford, and in part alſo

cold water to looſe its reward, leaſt (ſaith a Father) excuſe
ſhould be any from want of fewell to warm. Theſe things
again refreſhed and encouraged me to the tendry of ſmall
things, eſpecially when I called to minde the Great Apoſtles
ſtraights, who was fain to take up with a part-bountie, when
he had not wherewith to pay the whole: for <hi>Silver and Gold</hi>

will ſoon diſcern wants enough, and ſo do I; and that I hope
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58798:8"/>
is the chiefeſt fault: To have been better furniſhed with
books, arts, languages, records, means, company, might
both have ſtrengthned many a weak nerve, and ſupplied ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
an empty vacuity. But yet if but one half hereof be ſtrong,
of what I hope none is weak; if a moity true, of what I hope
none is falſe; there may be ſo much of it as it is, that he that
runs may read, and he that reads and underſtands will not (I
hope) herafter dare give leave to his Conſcience to conſent
to that, which if he have the honeſty of a Moor or Saracene,
he muſt ſtep back and pauſe, and decline; I mean, by reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out his hand to withdraw that, which if he were one of
the Sons of <hi>Pamphilio,</hi> he would let alone, or rather give;
or, in plain terms, not dare to with-hold his Tythes, unleſſe
he be reſolved to more then covet his neighbours Goods.</p>
            <p>This is a point of Religion very low in an age of Religion,
and for Religion pretending to ſoar ſo very high; But he that
has but this, cannot upon theſe grounds, do this evil, and ſin
againſt his God: If there be Civil Right, there muſt be
undoubtedly Civil wrong, (for they are Correlatives) fraud,
injuſtice, ſpoil, rapine, coveting, thieving; ſome of theſe, if
not all: and God grant there be not alſo upon the grounds,
and in the reputation of the Common-law, Sacriledg alſo, to
meddle with, and in this caſe to pervert what That Law ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts

to premiſe ſundry things of Right or Rights in generall, the
nature, ground, riſe, ſtrength, and originall firſt growth of
Them all, with this intent and purpoſe: That if we can
finde the reaſon of All, we may the better judge of Theſe: If
we doe finde theſe to have the ſame ſtrength and bottome to
reſt on, that all others have (to wit, humane paction and the
powerfull word of the ſevering all-giving Law, which alone
incloſes all from the common) in the ſame with others, we
may conclude, either theſe have enough, or none have any;

out, and of that naturall liberty of things, never yet brought
within the bondage of any acceſſary reſtraint, ſome evident

                  <p>Thus the current of <hi>Juſtinians</hi> works: That wiſe Law
that kept the World in awe, durſt never, never did declare
againſt all Community. Plainely it ſpeaks things left at firſt
Common, Servitude is by after-inducement; Property as
Servitude, and no ſuch univerſall reſtraint yet; but ſome
things remaine as free as the Wood for the Bird to come

And ſo for Dr <hi>Cowell</hi> late of <hi>Cambride,</hi> who profeſſing to
mould our Laws according to the patern of the Imperiall
(<hi>Inſtitutiones Juris Anglicani ad methodum &amp; ſeriem Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutionum

his Book:) In the ſecond, third, and fifth Titles of his firſt
Book, and firſt of the ſecond, has the ſame parallel things,
and near words; ſhewing indeed, that the Laws were pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels;
and, which was his Plot, in theſe things both alike.
I may not have omitted the Student to his Doctor; the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
is both Grave and ſerious, and were he in tranſmitta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Language, might gaine with time, and more Authority
after ſome Centuries then he has in preſent: Beſides other
places, He delivers himſelfe in his<note n="2" place="margin">Dial. 2. cap. 3. fol. 64.</note> Book thus: It is to be
knowne, for ſatisfying the doubt how the property of a
mans goods may be altered (as in an Out-lawry) without his
conſent; that, The property of Goods (he might have ſaid,
of Lands, the reaſon is the ſame; I beleeve he meant both,)
be not given to the Owner by the Law of Reaſon, nor by the
Law of God, but by the Law of man, and is ſuffered by the
Law of Reaſon, and the Law of God ſo to be. For at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
All goods were in Common; but after they were
brought by the Law of man into certaine Property, ſo that
every man may know his own, then were conditions aſſigned;
and ſo he proceeds to reſolve his doubt, by that one condition
(here) was then, that if a man were Out-lawed, he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
as a man not to be truſted, or an enemy &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Many other ſuch plaine Aſſertions are partly in This, and
Theſe, and partly in other our next to Oracle-Lawyers, which
joyned to what before; give, if not aſſurance, much probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
that the truth is, and the nature of things was at firſt, as
I ſay, or elſe there would not have been ſuch conſpiring teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
Agreeing Witneſſes is among the ſtrongeſt of
proofes, and a likely evidence that they all ſpeak the truth,
who all ſpeak the ſame; and as in neighbour Buildings
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58798:14"/>
their help and aſſiſtance is mutuall, and ones ſtrength
ſtrengthens another; ſo here. The grave Rules theſe have
been, and prevailing Miſtreſſes, if I may ſo ſay, whoſe words
have been obeyed to ſway a good part of the paſt and preſent
Chriſtian World: and they ſhould not have been empty Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
(<hi>Vox &amp; praterea nihil,</hi> as he ſaid of the Nightingale,)
mear ſpeeches or noyſe that went for nothing: The Canon
for the Church, the Civill for the Empire, and our Civill
for our Monarchy; what can we look for more, or more
Authorative, after ſo great and honourable atteſtations?</p>
                  <p>Neither hath the Realty of things been otherwiſe in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
ſometimes, then according to the matter held forth
in theſe Rules: There have been and Are, that have lived and
Doe live accordingly: perſons ſo compoſing themſelves that
they remaine happy without incloſure or guard, home or
own, and they never ſaw yet reaſon (which they obeyed) to
remove them from the benefis, (eſteemed ſuch, with all incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences)
that they found and had in this they ſtill thought
their moſt expedient Community; ſome ſimple Indians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it to this day; they will not exchange their Liberty for
our Wealth, nor their native, as we count it barbarous free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
for whatſoever we eſteeme better, richer, ſurer, and
nearer, comming unto us under the name of our magnified
Civility. They have not our advantages, ſo neither our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies,
our enriching Property, ſo neither our emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
vices and troubles. Take away this, there would be no
place left for many of thoſe we call Crimes that trouble the
World, nor temptations to others, which it might be our
happineſſe to bee free from, and ſuch as would perhaps
goe much toward the balancing of the benefit of our
Riches.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the Primitive Chriſtians lived Thus too: Wee

The <hi>Eſſenes</hi> held it up long with great applauſe, nor is any

had but gracious humility, and true love to make us capable
of ſo great a happineſs. But yet then we are in a wilderneſſe:

loves man ſo well, that he loves every Good of man: the
Good of Society, the Good of Order, the Good of Peace,
the Good of Benefit, even to that outward Beſtial part, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

be the Eccho of thoſe Texts, or elſe of your own thoughts
onely. But you ſeem to gather this Argument from the
words to manifeſt the verity of your thoughts.</p>
                  <p>He by whom all things were made is the moſt high God. But
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58798:22"/>
all things were made by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Ieſus Chriſt is the moſt High God.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall anſwer to your Major by diſtinguiſhing betwixt the
Agent Principall and Inſtrumental. That there may be in one
and the ſame work, one Principal and another Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
Agent none will deny. But whether there were in the
work of Creation one Principall, and another Inſtrumentall,
is a thing to be proved. That the <hi>Father</hi> was Principall
therein, and ſo the <hi>moſt high God,</hi> comes not under debate.
But whether the <hi>Son</hi> was onely Inſtrumental in that great
work of Creation, is the Controverſie, and muſt be the
ſubject of our preſent inquiry. I affirm, that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt
was onely an Inſtrumentall Agent in the Creation of the
worlds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reaſons by which, I ſhall at this time guard mine
aſſertion from ſuſpition of errour, are theſe that follow.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is drawn from the ſilence of all creatures. The
book of the Creatures,<note place="margin">Ex Creatione agnoſcitur De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, ſed non Deus pater fil. &amp; ſpir. fi quoniam vis illa efficiens quia mundus fuit creatus, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinet ad Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam Dei, non ad ſubſiſtentiam ejus perſonalem, <hi>Ameſius.</hi>
                     </note> as well as the book of the Scriptures,
ſpeak forth with open mouth, this ſacred truth that there is
one firſt cauſe, and Principall Agent of all things. Of a
Trinity of Perſons in Unity of Eſſence, as Principal Agents
in the work of Creation; the whole Creation is wholly ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent:
Wherefore our Divines acknowledg, that God is known
from the Creation, but not God the Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit, becauſe that efficient power, by which the world was
created, belongs to the Eſſence of God, not to his perſonall
ſubſiſtence.</p>
                  <p>Yet by their leave, God is a Perſon, all actions being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
unto perſons; and therefore by their grant, the works
of Creation hold forth but one Agent, who muſt needs be
the <hi>Principall</hi> (if not the only) Agent therein; for it is not
imaginable, that if there were then <hi>one Principall</hi> Agent,
they ſhould not all be equally diſcovered by the work, being
equally concerned in it: Therefore if Chriſt were an Agent,
he was but an inſtrumental one.</p>
                  <p>The Second Reaſon proceeds from the verdict of pure
Reaſon. If Reaſon may obtain credit, ſhe will tell us,
that there could be in the work of Creation but one Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:58798:23"/>
Agent, becauſe there is by nature and in way of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
but one God: For if there were two <hi>Principall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,</hi>
there muſt be <hi>two Gods</hi> in way of eminency, (the terms
being convertible) which to affirm would be abſurd, and eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſproved. And therefore if Jeſus Chriſt were any, he
was but an Inſtrumentall Agent in that work of Creation.</p>
                  <p>The Third Reaſon iſſues from the nature of Chriſts being.
That whole Chriſt is a creature, hath been already proved:
yet let me adde a word from <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 15. which doth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
precede the Text now in queſtion. Chriſt is there cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>the image of the inviſible God;</hi> and ſo is diſtinguiſhed
from God, becauſe the image and the thing whereof it is an
image are not the ſame; in that nothing can be the image of
its ſelf</p>
                  <p>Now he is called <hi>the image of the inviſible God,</hi> in that
God through him did principally manifeſt and declare his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Glory, and in that the chiefeſt Dominion of the creature
was by the Father committed to him; in this ſenſe man is
called the <hi>image and glory of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 7.</p>
                  <p>He is alſo called <hi>the firſt-born of every creature;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he is ranked among the creatures, yet ſo as that he is the
Head of them.</p>
                  <p>Now if whole Chriſt be a creature, then will it unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
follow, that he was but an Inſtrument in the work of
Creation: for God and creatures are contradiſtinct, and he
could not be, unleſs <hi>he</hi> were <hi>God,</hi> a Principall Agent.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Reaſon doth ſpring from the manner of Chriſts
working.</p>
                  <p>1. Though he had an hand in the Creation of the world,
yet was it not originally of him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6. where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
doth plainly ſhew us, <hi>that all things are of God, even the
Father, and that all things are by,</hi> not <hi>of Jeſus Christ,</hi> and
ſo the Son is diſtinguiſhed from the Father in the work of
Creation; the Father being the firſt cauſe, and originall of
all things, and Chriſt the inſtrument of the Father, by whom
he did manifeſt his Divine Glory in producing creatures.</p>

the world.</p>
                  <p>He is frequently called by the Fathers the Inſtrument and
Servant of God.</p>
                  <p>But you endeavour to ſtrengthen your Propoſition by a
Reaſon (ſuch as 'tis) drawn from impoſſibility; <hi>God could</hi>
(ſay you) <hi>make uſe of no inſtrument in the work of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
But Sir, this aſſertion derogates from Gods All-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency.
Is any thing impoſſible with God? Is any thing too
hard for the Lord?</p>
                  <p>2. It contradicts your own teſtimony. I remember that
in a Conference (where I exerciſed both ſilence and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
to the Glory of God,) ſince I received your paper, you
did affirm in the hearing of not few, <hi>that God might at firſt
have made an Angel, or ſome other creature, and by it have
made all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How to reconcile one with the other is a thing unfeaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and therefore you muſt confeſs, that you are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
infallible: yea, that ſometimes you differ from your
ſelf; and ſo 'tis no wonder, if you diſagree with others. But
what ſhall I take from your preſent judgement? Muſt your

and I may ſave a labour in returning an anſwer to that, which
follows in your paper: If the former, then you muſt recant
what you laſt ſaid, and I muſt not here make an end of my
Reply to your Major. The truth is, I honour Reaſon ſo

wherefore I ſhall honour Reaſon ſo much as not to

with Reaſons dreſs on it. Your Reaſon thus runs,</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe Creation is a making of all things out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and required an infinite power, God can make uſe
of no Inſtrument: inaſmuch as God cannot derive and
give an infinite power to any creature, becauſe no creature is
capable of ſuch a Divine Attribute, for it would make him
God, to be Almighty, or to be infinite in power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:58798:24"/>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhall not anſwer to all in this Reaſon which ſeems
not to be ſound doctrine, but only ſo far as the matter in hand
requires.</p>
                  <p>1. Though it be true that Gods infinite power was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
in the work of Creation: yet was not the Infinity of
his Power manifeſted fully in that, or any other work;
for he hath more power then ever yet he had need to uſe, or
then could in any work be fully declared.</p>
                  <p>2. Your aſſertion plainly denies the <hi>man Chriſt Jeſus to be
God; Almighty,</hi> or <hi>Infinite in power;</hi> for you ſay that God
could not give or derive an infinite power to any creature, and
that a creature cannot be God, Almighty, &amp;c. The man
Chriſt Jeſus was a <hi>creature,</hi> how then can that Perſon be <hi>God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The ground of your Argument is ſtraw and ſtubble;
For infinite power may be manifeſted by them, to whom 'tis
not communicated, and ſo their proper power; As is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in thoſe that <hi>wrought miracles and raiſed the dead,</hi> in
which infinite power was manifeſted, and yet the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
thereof were not in power infinite. The like might be
ſaid of Goſpel-Preachers, whom God makes his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in mens converſion, as great a work as the worlds
Creation. The ſame might be ſaid of Chriſt in his work of
our Redemption.</p>
                  <p>But enough of this.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now examine your Minor, which was, <hi>That all
things were made by Ieſus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is true, Chriſt being excepted, of whoſe Creatural be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I have already ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>Obj. <hi>But you will ſay, that in</hi> Iohn 1. 3. <hi>it is ſaid,</hi> That all
things were made by him, and without him was nothing Made,
that was Made.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> The words are to be reſtrained to all thoſe things
which by the uſe of an inſtrument were made and created.
In the firſt verſe of this Chapter, the creation of Jeſus Chriſt
is included, and in this third verſe he is ſpoken of as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
of God in creating all things, and therefore is here
to be excepted. As when <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt,
(<hi>John</hi> 3. 32.) ſaid, <hi>What he hath ſeen and heard that he teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58798:24"/>
and no man receiveth his teſtimony;</hi> it is evident that
<hi>Iohn</hi> was to be excepted. Perſons are ſometimes ſegregated
from others of the ſame kinde, in way of eminency, being
chief amongſt them. Thus in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 1. where 'tis ſaid, <hi>that</hi>
David <hi>ſang that ſong, when the Lord delivered him from the
hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of</hi> Saul. What,
was <hi>Saul</hi> none of <hi>Davide</hi> enemies? he was the chiefeſt, and
therefore ſegregated from the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus having taken off the Charet wheels of your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Concluſion cannot advance up by its aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>I Come now to <hi>Heb.</hi>

he was God. But he was neither <hi>the Father, nor the Son,

Coming I verily beleeve at firſt from the patern of <hi>Judah, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi,
Simeon and Benjamin,</hi> by exemplification:) If any man
ſhould attempt it, he might be partial; if none, the thing
not done: ſo that ſuppoſing a partition needful, and ſome to
doe it, and no revelation from heaven, (ſave in paterne or
general rules,) we can lay hold of no other umpire or Judge
like to be fit to do it, then that voice of wiſedome (implying
all mens conſents) which is in the Law; the gracious goodneſs
of God aſſiſting the grave wiſdom of man, yea, inabling and
authoriſing it to ſet bounds hereby to our appetites, &amp; maſter
our unreaſonable, proud, headſtrong deſires; giving luſt a
law, covetouſneſs a law, the hand a law, nay, the eye a law,
that it may not ſo much hereafter as greedily covet what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers.
This is that which bindes the Bear and ſhackles
the wolf, lays fetters upon our wilde and forreſt deſires, that
elſe would make us very apt to hearken to temptation to be
preying one upon another. But this reſtraines our fury, and
locks up the Lion in the grate, bidding, yea forcing all

received amongſt us it is, that I am to ſucceed in my fathers
fee: I have right to ſucceed, I may claim my right; and I
have wrong if I be kept out of my due &amp; lawful inheritance.
For our Law hath divided much land into ſuch tenures, (upon
reaſons of profound wiſdom not diſcernable to every comon
apprehenſion,) that hath willed I ſhould ſucceed my father,

that our own nationall, home-binding Laws have ſetled as
they have; That, is Here nothing elſe, right or wrong.</p>
                  <p>Some ſeem to go farther, in requiring to property in the

or as others, <hi>An gratia ſit fundamentum dominii temporalis?</hi>
but (beſides that, the diſcuſſion hereof moves properly in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

deſires may not be altogether irregular: for of that Civill
Right we ſpeak of, they require and ſeem to have enough in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58798:29"/>
Civill determinations. To purifie ſo the conſcience in the
ſight of God, they may ſay perhaps we muſt have more;
our nature amended, by Chriſt ſanctified, and by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of him himſelf owned, and ſo only to the Pure are
all things Thus pure: But to peace and order and right
among men, here the determinations of the lower ſcene are
enough; and he breaks humane laws that couzens or ſteals
what is but ſo ſetled by them; and by conſequent Gods, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Mans.</p>
                  <p>It were hard to ſay, that, as on the one ſide a ſanctified man
ſhould finde no more ſweet in Gods bleſſings of the ſame
kinde then a heathen or a publican; ſo on the other, that
any ſhould be ſo vain to think that a wicked man is thereby
an out-law, having no faſter ſeat in his poſſeſſions, then that a
godly neighbor may turn him our of doors to morrow, and
by vertue of his ſhare in Chriſt (the heir of all things) create
himſelf a principality in preſent of all the wicked mens wealth
in the world. The Indian is ſure maſter of his own gold and
ſpices; the King of Spain of his Indies; and a Jew or Turk
of their ſeverall Owns; nor can the moſt deboiſt Ruffian
amongſt us (worſe in ſome regard then <hi>Turk, Spaniard,</hi> or
<hi>Indian</hi>) but be ſo true and rightfull a Maſter of his own
wealth, that his moſt helliſh wickedneſs cannot turn him out
of it in this world, (unleſs his prodigality do) that he ſhould
be henceforth a thief of his own wine or cates, or ſo meer an
uſurper that any of Gods ſervants may uſurp from him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and rob him as the Iſraelites did the Egyptians in
equity and conſcience. Far be this from every one has truly
learned Chriſt ſo to think or do. 'Tis fit every ſwine have his
own ſtye, every dog be let alone in own kennell: The grace
of Chriſt teaches us to uſe our own, not cenſure others; to
be thankfull for what we have, not covet what is other mens.
There were that it hath been laid to their charge they have
endevoured to ſubvert thoſe laws, to bring in the Civill, and
do ſome ſuch things as <hi>Stephen</hi> was accuſed to ſay Jeſus of

been ſuch a tranſcendent attempt both of folly and tyranny
that it would have uſhered in more injury then ever the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror
could, who changed the Governor, but could not

he ſet himſelf a new head at top, and would have rendred
them queſtionleſs guilty of that <hi>Crimen laeſae Majeſtatis,</hi> or
higheſt offence, whereof <hi>Glanvill</hi> ſpeaks in the very beginning
of his Book, <hi>De nece vel ſeditione domini Regis vel Regni,</hi>
leaving little elſe for a foraign Enemy to do, ſith the taking
off theſe would conſequentially have taken away all things.
For pretend they to amend hereby what they would, bring
in the twelve Tables, the politicall part of the wiſe <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi>
the Partidaes of <hi>Spain,</hi> Arreſts of <hi>France,</hi> or whole

uncertainty, and to thoſe that had any thing the
worſt undoing even by law, and that this ſhould ſettle them
beſides their own, all they are now owners of: For new
inſtruments, muſt have a new work, a new-faſhioned rule draw
a new-formed line, a new Law have a new Righteouſneſſe,
and ſo our Fees, Socages, Burgages, Claims, Entries, &amp;c.
would all have been put out of their old courſe, into another,
that new, and perhaps not conſiſtent with our Government,
perhaps, not with our ſelves; and in a word, a New right,
and what were then become of the old, and All, as many as
had any thing by it? Some would have ſtuck to this; others
to that; another parcell to neither; a fourth (only to the

No whole part can tell whither to take, and unity being gone,
thereby a new ſad way paved in diviſion, to war, poverty,
ruine, deſolation, and by Anarchy extreme diſorder and very
confuſion. Let them bear their rebuke whoſoever they be
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58798:30"/>
that ſhould have attempted things ſo monſtrouſly exorbitant,
and full of ſin as well as injuſtice; All 'tis like would have been
hereby at ſtake, if not All loſt: for our Law gives and preſerves
us All, and the taking away this, or changing, muſt needs then
have taken away or indangered All: According to what a
Lord Chief Juſtice ſaid not long ſince, The Law is the moſt
common birth-right that the Subject hath for the ſafeguard

                  <p>And thus my Porch or preparatory Preface ſeems well nigh
finiſhed, raiſed upon ſix Pillars, as I take it, of firmneſſe
enough, touching the nature, ground, riſe, growth, ſtrength,
and perfection of ours and all Civill Rights. There may
have been ſome miſtake in tempering the morter, diſordering
the materials, or blemiſhing the whole by unskilfull hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
but the truths howſoever ſeem ſolid, and their uſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
chiefly in this, relating (for which they were given)
to all follows, That, if this be the nature of Civill Right, and
All mens beſt, and tythes have This, in any ones diſturbing
them, he muſt needs diſturb what hath the common founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in with-holding them he with-holds what is due by as
good Right, as any man claimes any thing by, he undermines
that which is the ſtay and ſupport of his own houſe or wealth,
and does what if the like ſhould be done to him, would leave
him Nothing, becauſe He deſtroys that preſerves and gives
to him and All others Every thing. If we all reſt upon one
ſtrength, and this be it, imbarque in one bottom, ſtand upon
one leg, and ſettle upon one and the ſame bough, let any
Engliſhman take heed how he meddle with this common
ſupport, leſt he infirm his own, and not be too venturous
of the ſtrokes of his Axe, for fear of danger to himſelf, by
cutting the bough himſelf in his greatneſſe, ſtands upon. He
may think to pare about craftily, and with ſuch prudent cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and an eye to himſelf, weaken the whole, that there be
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58798:31"/>
ſtrength enough left to ſupport his Own Right: But this is
neither ſafe nor honeſt: Not ſafe to tamper with a common
foundation, to ſprinkle fire in the next thatch, that may catch
home; to bore a hole at the other end of the veſſel where a
neighbours wealth lyes, thinking his own ſafe. Not honeſt,
to deſigne any other mens equally Juſt and Due rights to be
fed and preyed upon, to increaſe ones own heap, by taking
(or with-holding) from anothers, or to wiſh the next houſe
pulled down, and the inhabitants turned to the Common,
that one may take as much as he needs of the ſpoil to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
or ſtrengthen the Studds of ones own building.</p>
                  <p>That which is juſt and Right ſhalt thou do, is the rule of
the holy Law, This is neither: That thy Brother may live
as well as Thou, a mercifull and conſcionable rule in Iſrael;
This takes away Brother <hi>Levi</hi>'s life, and leaves him a Beggar
with others plenty. A Beggar is not uncapable of bounty,
nor unfurniſhed with a hand to take what another ſhall arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily
give: But we are not ſo unacquainted with the holy
Law of God, as not to know what heavy cenſures are there
regiſtred againſt thoſe whoſe oppreſſion, covetouſneſſe, or
with-holding what is due ſhall make beggars. Now <hi>Levi's</hi>

briefly, Manifold. It often comes to

him, it is Mine and not His, becauſe I have Kept it. Theſe
things are known enough, and I aver they all meet here, that
Tythes Were given, Are poſſeſſed, and Long enough to create
preſcription; A threefold cord is not eaſily broken, and here
is that complication of 1. Donation ſufficient. 2. Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
undoubted. 3. And Preſcription for time over and over.
To which adde, that each of theſe pillars hath alſo another
ſtrong ſtay by, to ſupport the weight laid on it: Donation is
bettered by Confirmation: Poſſeſſion ſecured by him in
whoſe right the poſſeſſion is; <hi>Dedimus Deo</hi> was the form of
grant, and is the ground ſo claim: Preſcription is lengthened
through more then half twenty times over ſo much as would
ſimply ſerve the turn: And if theſe things be ſo, and they
are, and all, and known, by the Law, be this ſuppoſed, and
me thinks we may ſing <hi>victoria</hi> almoſt already.</p>
               <p>But they remain to be proved; by Gods bleſſing they ſhall:
There is neither of them but lies clear in view to thoſe are
acquainted in thoſe regions of knowledge (whether of Books
or Experience) where a likely information of any of them
is to be looked for; and I ſhall yet add one thing more as a
Coronis at top, the opinion of the Learned in their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.
One ſingle ſelf may have been deceived not inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſably;
'Tis hard for a ſtander by to be acquainted in all the
rooms of a neighbors houſe; ſome ſparks of true light have
ſometimes (by their not right uſe) but led private men to
Errour; But as witneſſes produced go for proof uſually, and
their agreement ſtrengthens their teſtimony, and a conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them profeſſing to know, is the faireſt of all preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
againſt miſtake.</p>
               <p>If therefore the Lawyers themſelves have apprehended
thus with me, if they have combined and conjoyned to ſay ſo,
if there have bin that combination and conſent that they All
have ſaid ſo, and till within theſe few years no One would
have been Fee'd to the contrary; nor, if he underſtands him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
will yet: from All theſe I ſhall not doubt to inferr a
ſtrength of preſumption, that what men have ſaid, the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
have ſaid, the Lawyers have ſaid, and All of them both
have and doe, (no one to be hired to the contrary, whereas
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58798:34"/>
they come in <hi>gratis</hi> on the other part,) hath much more
then likelihood that it may be true which they aver, and for
their aſſertion ſake. From whence may we expect Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
if not from the voice of men, of All men, and they
agreeing, and the Seers themſelves giving their vote? <hi>In ore

no plea, that no one will be hired to undertake, or can
colour for, that neither hath ſubſtance nor ſhew. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the grave and learned Judges (the Oracles of the Law)
have gone this way, if the other reverend Sages (I compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
all graduated profeſſors) take in along with them, if it
be the painfull knowledg of the Student, the coſtly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg

                     <p>All which things and the re-inforcement of ſo many, do ſhew how hardly men were drawn off their own wayes: what need the Commandment of God hath of the abetting law of man that it may take place; and how clearly and fully that may be after given by man, which God appointed to be given: And this, 'tis like, a that alone, which gave the due Sabbath day to God here with us.</p>

obedience to that command, but freely in it ſelf, ſet aſide

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58798:35"/>
they had not been free: but now, beſides the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
it is ſecondly due to humane Juſtice (appointing it,)
to have the Sabbath ſanctified: So, Give the Lord the Tenth
with a good eye, is interpreted to us the heavenly Oracle;
yet when the believers came to obey, they did it freely, which
they might not have done: <hi>Nullo jure cogente,</hi> that is, none of
the ſame ſort, none on the ſame floor, no humane lower poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
law having ſet aſide any thing, or commanded, though the
higher Divine law had bound it to be more then expedient,
which yet might not have been obeyed. The ſumme is, God
may have ſaid, the Tenth ſhould be paid, Man have not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed;
but he did, and gave by the perſwaſive influence of
Divine command, that which was his own, and he was bound
by no humane Law before to have given: and ſo here is a

with the head, that which was to <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
or in that <hi>Auguſtines</hi> time whom ſome love
to call the Apoſtle of the Engliſh men: who found moſt of
this Engliſh part of the Iſle as Barbarous, as the whole is
like to be when covetous men may ſave this expence. We
cenſure not what the grace or power of God can do, but in
likelyhood what he will. Miracles are not to be multiplyed
without cauſe, nor he to be put out of his ordinary courſe of
By-cauſes; according to which we are likewiſe to expect and
judge that will be, in humane probability is by them Like to
be. He then found here the land dark as <hi>Sodome,</hi> the ſouls
of men over-ſpread with Atheiſm and Idolatry, and no truth
or knowledg of God, which he divulged ſucceſsfully, and
took care, (or the bleſſed Providence of God brought to paſs)
that the Vine and the Elm were planted and have grown com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
together, Chriſtian Religion and this acknowledged
good ſupport thereof being by one and the ſame Hand here
planted and rooted; and as they were born, and have lived,
if any be, God grant as Twins they be not taken away toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>But whence does this appear? we ſhould gladly have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
it up from <hi>Bede</hi> or <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> or any other creditable
ſtory, but we have it from what was more authentick, the moſt
ſubſtantiall credit of a ſolemn law: By all mens leave, This
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58798:36"/>
ſhall be more creditable then any private Mans words; what
is planted and ſhining in any publick paſt law, being leſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

were then repreſented together to confirm both ways, Civilly

<hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and ſo was granted by the King, the Lords, and

               <p>Thus far that ſolemn Law, the authority of whoſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
we ſhall<note n="2" place="margin">Vid. pa 90, 91, &amp;c.</note> hereafter more fully ſet forth, when, for
the ſake thereof, we ſhall ſhew the whole collection to be one
of the ancienteſt pieces of the Common law, ſo often called
for by the people, confirmed by the King, and entred into the
Coronation Oath, &amp;c. In the mean while, by all the credit
this teſtimony can give, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> preached Tythes, the
People believed, the King and Parliament granted; for what
can be leſs meant by, <hi>Conceſſa ſunt à Rege, Baronibus, &amp;

Corn, Milk, Honey, and moſt particulars claimed.</p>
               <p>Let no man take advantage, by thinking me ſo unadviſed
as to ſuppoſe Parliaments ſo early under that name, which I
know came in long after, and whatſoever ſhould carry that
title applyed in ſtrictneſs to any thing beyond a good way in
the Norman times, I ſhould ſuſpect it for Counterfeit: but
that Publick meeting which had the power and vote of the
Land, conſiſting of the Head and its ſubordinate Members,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58798:37"/>
call it Senate, Gemote, Court, Councell, or whatſoever elſe,
the Collection and Congregation of the Land granted
this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> I know well what may be ſaid to the contrary:
as that <hi>Bede</hi> who lived ſoon after, and reports that ſtory
of Converſion at large,<note place="margin">Vid. Hiſt. Eccleſ. lib. 1. cap. 26. in fiu. &amp; cap. 27. Interog. 1.</note> and is moſt authentick for thoſe
times and the following, ſayes nothing of any ſuch thing:
not when he had juſt occaſion ſo to doe: for he ſpeaks
both of <hi>Auguſtines</hi> entertainment (<hi>a few lands</hi>) and his
ſending back to Rome about Church-maintenance in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
and how it ſhould be divided, but not a word of
TYTHES.</p>
               <p>Whereunto I anſwer, True this: but, what then?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Negative teſtimonies are the weakeſt of proofs,
upon the matter no proof at all; as ſilent witneſſes that ſay
nothing.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Bede</hi> had ſaid any thing we ſhould have much liſtened,
and that whether he had ſpoke againſt or for us; but ſaying
nothing he is but a mute, and no more to be regarded ſtrictly,
then he that is called, comes in, and is ſilent.</p>
               <p>2. As to his yet mentioning other things neer, the time of
both was but when yet things were raw: when he had not
preached, nor the people beleeved, or in reward ſetled what
they may have afterwards. Time does much, nothing is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
and perfected at once; the ſtory is plain, the queſtions
ſent to Rome, of which we have account, were, the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of <hi>Auſtines</hi> ſucceſs: and petition for ſupply of Councel
thence, and ſo might prevent what was after done, and it be
too ſoon there to mention what was not till after, granted.</p>
               <p>3. And the firſt of thoſe queſtions was onely of oblations, as
a part, and whereof might be the greateſt doubt, not excluſive
of other things.</p>
               <p>4. Neither were thoſe oblations all that was, poſitively: for
<hi>Auſtine</hi> had then other things, &amp; ſo that expreſſion not ſo full
and comprehenſive as to infer any thing from it as compleat.

Anglorum ſacro tinctus eſt Baptiſmate,</hi> the firſt of Chriſtians.
Now for <hi>Ina</hi> we are ſure enough of him, by the laws extant,
he had none ſuch; if <hi>Offa</hi> had, then either this was that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fred</hi>
related to, or it was not. If it were, then has <hi>Offa</hi>'s
Law much confirmation in this of <hi>Alfred:</hi> If it were not,
there could be no other to relate to, but this of <hi>Ethelbert.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. Yet more likely, for that before Any other Act paſſed
(this of <hi>Offa</hi> or any other, that we read of) here were tythes
ſaid to be paid: For<note n="5" place="margin">In an Epiſtle to Cuthbert Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, <hi>de corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendis vitiis Anglorum,</hi> about the year 745. id pag. 240.</note>

                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:58798:38"/>
This ſure: we have here a plain affirmation, in a clear law,
and ſo not raſhly to be left for any private conjectures, or
blinde preſumptions, and that in ſuch a place, that, ſave in
<hi>Domus-Dei</hi> book, or a few other, we might not look for
more authentick from the tendryes of that age. Some cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
uſes to be given to places; we leaſt ſuſpect forgery in a
Church-window, or Palace-Inſcription; and an hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
truth ſhall never ſhine with that evidence, light and
credibility to my ſoul from <hi>Tacitus</hi> or <hi>Tranquillus,</hi> as
caſually let fall or ingraven in the face of a Roman-law, or
publikly inſcribed in the commanding Pandects or Novells.
Eſpecially ſith, here was ſaid to be a conſent of King and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
which laſt if they had not conſented, here would have been
worke enough: every ſimple man would have been a ſingle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer,
&amp; every neighbour at hand a ready witneſs: Kings Acts
may have many eyes upon them; but to father any thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the people undone or untrue, were to create a Commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of enemies at once, every one with his accuſation ready to
clamor loud enough againſt the forgery.</p>
               <p>We will ſay then, <hi>Auſtine</hi> preached tythes; and the King,
Barons, and people beleeved, and obeyed and conferred
them: And obſerve thereon, their date began with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
entertainment; tything and preaching went together at
the firſt, from the firſt and alwayes. 'Tis uncourteous to
part old friends, hard to ſlope the skin from the fleſh, dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
what hath long gone and grown together. Accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
food proves lightly wholſomeſt, they that change for better
often fall ſick of their remedy, and to be weaned from that
an aged man hath been accuſtomed to, and found wholeſome
from infancy, cannot but create much danger to the body by
change, if not utter diſſolution. Which 'tis eaſie to apply
here; and ſith, miniſter to Chriſt, and live by Tythes, are ſo
intwined together among us as they are, and alwayes have
been, God grant the event extend not beyond good mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
intents, doubts, or fears, that the whole frame of the long
continued Church, ſink and fayle, upon ſtirring (if they
ſhould be ſtirred) this united and neer co-incorporate pillar
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58798:38"/>
that hath hitherto outwardly ſuſtained it. If it be charge or
trouble, it may be born by the experience of a thouſand
years: If men love their eaſe now, ſo they did heretofore:
If they are now wiſe, they were not then altogether deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of wiſdom: Lay together, that the clear policy of the
Old-Teſtament went thus all along, the generall practiſe of
the New-Teſtament hath been according; Here with us ever
ſince the bright ſhine of the Goſpel diſpelled heatheniſh
darkneſs, and from the very day-break of Chriſtianity to this
inſtant, it hath been judged beſt, and is; what new plots
would do is uncertain, and may have the accompanying dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of experiment upon ſick or ſound bodies to diſturb what
is ſtrong, or ruine what is decaying.</p>

               <p>If we well conſider the words of the chiefeſt of thoſe anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
that is, Ingulphus, we may conjecture that the purpoſe of
the Charter was to make a general grant of tyths payable free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and diſcharged from all kinde of exactions uſed in that time,
according as the Monk of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> and <hi>John Pike</hi> in his
ſubplement of the Hiſtory of England expreſs it. <hi>Decimam</hi> (ſay
they) <hi>omnium hidarum infra regnum ſuum a tributis et exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onibus
Regis liberam Deo donavit:</hi> that is, granted the tythe
of the profits of all lands, free from all exactions. For the
granting of the tenth part of the Hides or Plowlands, denotes
the tenth of all profits growing in them as well as <hi>Decima acra
ſicut aratrum peragrabit,</hi> which is uſed for the tything of the
profits, in the Laws of King <hi>Edgar, Ethelred, &amp;c.</hi> and
doubtleſs <hi>Ingulphus</hi> no otherwiſe underſtood it then of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
right of tythes given to the Church, where he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
it with <hi>tunc primo cum decimis, &amp;c.</hi> So that the tythe of
prediall or mixt profits was given, it ſeems, perpetually by
the King with conſent of his States both Secular and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick,
and the tyth of every mans perſonal poſſeſſions were at
that time alſo expreſly included in the guift, becauſe (it
ſeems) before that, (<hi>hitherto that learned man</hi>) the payment of
all tythes had commonly been omitted. <hi>Not ſo neither; for
what was then the operation of thoſe weak, and yet intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſtrong and powerful Canons before mentioned, made with
ſo good advice, and ſtrengthened with the twiſted powers of
both States in</hi> Mercia <hi>and</hi> Northumberland, <hi>beſides what in</hi>
Kent, a Rege, Baronibus &amp; Populo? <hi>But for All the land,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58798:42"/>
it ſeems none before had power of impoſition; and for</hi> Weſt-Saxony
<hi>none had attempted; (for the King that was preſent
at opening of the letters, we found not there at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of the buſineſſe</hi>
                  <note n="1" place="margin">Pag. 70.</note> before:) <hi>So that</hi> Tunc primùm
<hi>for this and for All together, the decree might go forth here
ſucceſſefully, and the liker it did, for that (as before) we
read of no more Donation, but Confirmation, no need to Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
after, but order, as was ſaid, to Pay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that conſidering the power was then veſted in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch-granter,
and alſo the conſent of Tributary, and, as it
were, pupil-Kings, with Nobles, Peers, and all their people:
Conſider likewiſe the interpretation of dark words by thoſe
whoſe inſpection was like to pierce deepeſt into the meaning
of what was delivered (or is perplexed) with obſcure expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
And after interpretation fairly ſetting of ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
we need not doubt to conclude: That ſo long agoe as
thoſe remote times, about 800 years ſince, above 200 before
the Conqueſt, even then when the Common Law was but in
her ſwadling-clothes, whereof little hitherto, (if ſhe were
then born, as I beleeve ſhe was,) Even then, and as ſoon and
faſt as we may believe the power of Chriſtian Religion to
have had its work in the boſome of beleevers to make them
contrive a continuall and ſetled ſupport for their ſoul-ſaving
new-come Goſpel, Tythes had a publick vote, which crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a legall Right; And, though I will not ſay All was done
accordingly, and the objection of after Arbitrary conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
poſſible in ſome ſenſe, may take place in their way not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding;
yet as farre as Law may create a right, Then
were Tythes no longer a part of Benevolence and Bounty,
but of diſtributive or retributive Juſtice, every one living
within the compaſſe of the Church being bound to pay back
this ſupport for the Miniſtery thereof, in fulfilling thoſe
generall Canons of the New-Teſtament, that call for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and would not have the labourer uncertain of his
reward, but the Oxes mouth unmuzzled (to take thus much)
and the Catechiſt to partake with the Catechumene in all his
goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:58798:43"/>
For we are not to look upon Regall and Legall commands;
as empty Cracks, fit onely to fill the world with noiſe and
clamour, and exerciſe the chat of the buſie multitude, or
learned mens diſcourſes, but Canons well mounted, which
being diſcreetly levelled alſo, are able to make their way
through whole ſquadrons of oppoſing Rebels to Law and
Juſtice, of that irreſiſtible power, that though private men
would, they cannot contradict, evade, or gainſay; As being

ſee things done, but they who by their work were to be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for their labour? Which was much, and as much as could
be expected, in tender regard to what (of that little account
is,) findes ſo much place, and in very faſt and ſafe accordance
to what had been before. Indeed it ſhould be ſo: States
ſhould be conſtant. Not uncertainly whiffling up in looſe and
various decrees, but be gravely ſtayed and fixed to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
orders, Not giving the world occaſion to think their
Laws are Humane Ordinances by this, That they change like
men; but partaking in ſtedfaſtneſs with him from whom they
are, reſemble Him in Immutability who is the Same for Ever.
Juſtice and Truth are never but the ſame; Why ſhould then
their Rules vary? The ſame thing cannot be right and wrong
at times; why ſhould the Lesbian rule warp hither and thither,
as 'twere to ſay it is! It may make the jealous world ſuſpect
ere long that Lawes are nothing elſe but witty devices to
ſerve the contrivers own turn, if, like the ſayles of a ſhip,
they may be ſhifted and turned hither and thither upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
and cauſe them wiſh perhaps rather they had no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance

finding ſuſpicion in the ſanctuary of their refuge, and
doubting what was given for their wealth may prove an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of their falling. The firmneſs of a publick decree

               <p>This the wiſe and victorious <hi>Dane</hi> knew, (perhaps by
cheriſhing ſuch axiomes and perſwaſions at home victorious)
which made him ſtrike in as much as might be with the paſt
and eſtabliſhed Laws, to ſhake the Kingdom the leſs by a
Couqneſt, and in their ſtability to provide for much of the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:58798:49"/>
wholes, and his own. As indeed this courſe often leaves a
Kingdom ſafe with change of the head, and Government
quiet upon any change of Governours. For the perſon at
top is never ſo material as the diffuſed and coincorporate
Law throughout the body politick, which ſettles down and
is conveyed, as the branching Nerves, into every the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt
member of the re-publike, and which if it ſuffer trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

or ſuffer any conſiderable diſtention, laxation, mutation, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
trouble or diſturbance whatſoever; which alſo the
next Norman Conquerour found or was taught; for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that was in part willing (or were forced) to receive him,
would never yet give conſent that their laws (the ſinews of
the State) ſhould be touched, which put him upon this hard
Dilemma either to imbrace Theſe, or be rejected by Thoſe,
to let Them alone, or Himſelf never ſhould have been quiet.</p>

ſelf chiefly in this, that, (treading in the ſteps of K. <hi>Knout</hi>

and whatever wit or paſſion might ſuggeſt to the contrary,
knew it was ſafeſt always hearkning to reaſon and going in

So the Great was but taken out of the other Charters, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
(with ſome variation) what they had granted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and there is urged authority for that derivation, which
their compariſon and conſent will well enough make good.
Thus having brought theſe Laws among the Charters, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
them, and to the laſt and Great; They now with
eaſe and pliableneſs enough come along and have a place
in the Petition of Right, where That was owned ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
and as many Ratifications as there were intercedent,
even Parliamentary, ſo many-muſt be acknowledged to fall
in by the way (at leaſt by implication) Hither: Of that
great Law of Tythes I mean, which having ſo fair and
eminent a place in K. <hi>Edwards,</hi> muſt alſo have as full and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
a ratification all along in that bulk of laws ſo ratified,
which juſtly occaſioned this Narrative; And by it we ſee a
a part of that ſtrength the Law of Tythes hath on this ſide
the Conqueſt, even in the Common Law ſtill, by that it was
part of it at firſt, and a very remarkable part of that is taken
to have been the foundation and firſt riſe of the beginning
of the Common Law, and ſince hath, as now, been ſeen, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
and approved with it all along, with impetuous rage
and violence called for by the people of the land, and they
would never be quiet but under this Regiment, or without
theſe beloved orders whereof Tythes were a conſiderable
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:58798:59"/>
and eminent part. If they had been preſſed upon them by
thoſe were intereſſed by profit, or the tyranny of command
from above had ſettled, or kept them upon their weak and
declining ſhoulders, as unwilling as unable to bear, Reaſon
would there ſhould be at leaſt ſome more colour of ſtrugling
to free themſelves from the force, and their hands have leave
to looſe their necks from the yoak of unjuſt impoſition; But
ſith they deſired them, beſpake them, contended for them,
and would not be denyed, but fought that they might pluck
and keep that Burden upon themſelves; what can be more
equall then that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as their own act binde themſelves, ſo their
inheritours and ſucceſſours alſo, and that whether to gain or
to loſſe, yea, to loſſe as well as to gain, they ſtand to them,
and every good man with his own whether Act or Right,
ſit down and Reſt ſatisfied and very well contented?</p>
               <p>Moſt things indeed finde ſome oppoſition; few are ſo
happy to eſcape altogether free, and ſome Perſons may
perhaps think good to doubt of All here: As, <hi>whether
theſe references disperſed and repreſented as before, point to

               <p>But the chief ſtrength of theſe Dues was in this Interval
in the Church, and ſo properly to our days, and the diſcuſſion

came in, as the ſupport and maintenance, That now, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>By the way, we may not about theſe times much look

(if the power be able to ſupport and bear it ſelf out,) doth

it will come home ſhortly to us, and we ſhall have confuſion

Nonas Iulii.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here, they ſay, was firſt a Parochial Right eſtabliſhed:
And if ſo, a Right; which I think none will deny, and is all
I contend for: and the Lord Chief Juſtice grants it his way;
though not by force of the Decretal, yet as Juſt and Right
it was allowed, and ſo became <hi>Lex terrae.</hi> Any way ſerves
the turn, and if the Poſition, much more the Suppoſition:
If a <hi>Parochial</hi> right, then a <hi>Right,</hi> at leaſt. Review ſome of
the words: to which purpoſe, The grievance complained of
was, that Many did not pay their whole Tythes, <hi>Decimas ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
integras vel duas partes ipſarum</hi>—to their own Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
but at pleaſure: So they paid, the thing was done, And

again too what before, and adde the ſo often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
confirmation to us of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. If a ſteward can do
nothing, yet if a Lord ratifie, the Act is good: If the Chaplain
be over-buſie in a family, yet if the Maſter confirm, now 'tis
valid, though the thing were beſides his Cure: So if the Pope
medled with that he ſhould not, the King and State looking
on, and not contradicting but conſenting and approving; Here
ſeems now a conſummation of all-ſufficiency of power at the
firſt, and time going on to ripen what at firſt production was
but raw, a growing up to all perfection. And ſo in that
which next follows which I take to be of the ſame to the ſame,
wherein reſolution was given about new-broke grounds,
ſuppoſing, I underſtand the Tythes of a place to be payable
to a perſon, or Church out of the Pariſh, who ſhould then
have thoſe new Tythes? 'Tis anſwered in favour of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
Church there, <hi>That Church; unleſs the forainer can
ſhew a very fair plea for them: Cum enim perceptio deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum

(ſo far it was gone then,) <hi>decimae novalium quae fiunt in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochiis

Sith of Common right Tythes did belong to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh

                              <p>Whereas by reaſon of
divers ways of tything in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Churches, ſtrife and
contention are wont to ariſe
between the Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
and his people; we
will and appoint, that through
the Province of <hi>Canterbury</hi>
there be this uniform way
of Tything. Firſt, wee will
that Tythes be paid of Fruit
without any deduction of
charge intirely, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diminution, (ſo reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in an order about the
charge of Fermage, ſpoken
of before, and preventing
that exception;) and of
fruit of trees likewiſe, and
of all ſeeds and garden
hearbs, unleſs the Pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58798:69"/>
will make ſome compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
exception for them. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
we will and appoint, that
Tythes be required of hay,
(or green graſs, if it be cut
to ſpend, ſays <hi>Lyndewood</hi> in
his Gloſſe) wherever it grow,
in greater Meadows, or leſſer,
or in the High-ways, and that
it be paid as is beſt for the
Church: For breed of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
as, touching Lambs, we
appoint that for ſixe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
ſo many half pence; if
there be ſeven, the ſeventh
ſhall be tythe, yet ſo, that
the Church-Govenour recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the ſeventh, ſhall pay 3
half-pence to the Pariſhioner:
He that takes one of eight, a
penny, one of nine, a half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penny;
or let the Rector ſtay
for the tenth, if he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to the following year.
And he that ſo ſtays, let him
alwayes have the ſecond or
third beſt of the following
yeare, and this for his ſtay.
And ſo is it to be underſtood
of the tenth of Wooll. But
if the Sheep depaſture one
where in Winter, another
where in Summer, the tythe
is to be divided. In like
manner if any one ſhall buy
them in the middle of the
year, and it be known from
what Pariſh the ſheep come,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:58798:69"/>
the tythe is to be divided, as
of a thing belonging to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
places; but if it be not
known, let the Church have
the benefit where they are
at ſhear-time. Concerning
Milk, we will that the tythe
be paid as it ariſeth, that is,
of Cheeſe, ſo long as it is
made, and of milk in Autumn
and Winter, unleſs the Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioners
will make due com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of the tythe, and to the
Churches advantage. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the profits of Mils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we
will that tythes be faithfully
&amp; intirely paid. As for paſture
and feeding grounds, as well
Common as other, we appoint
the tythe be fully paid, and
this with regard to the Beaſts
and time of going, as ſhall be
beſt for the Church. For
Fiſhings and Bees, as of any
other goods honeſtly gotten,
which renew yearly, we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point,
that the tythe be paid
and required duly. We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
alſo, that perſonal tythes
be paid by Handy-crafts-men
and Merchants, that is, of the
gain of their trading; the like
of Carpenters, Smiths, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
Weavers, and all other
hired Labourers, that they
give the tythe of their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
unleſs they will give any
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58798:70"/>
thing certain toward the Light
in the Church, and this at the
Church-governors choice—</p>
                              <p>Then (after ſome words of
Mortuaries.) But becauſe
there are many that refuſe to
pay their tythes, we will, that
Pariſhioners be warned once,
twice and thrice, (which was
the number of eſſoyns allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Conquerours Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as before) to pay their
tythes to God and the Church
truly. Or if they refuſe, they
be firſt ſuſpended from entring
into the Church, and ſo bee
compelled by Eccleſiaſticall
cenſure, if need be, to pay.
Or if they require releaſe or
abſolution from ſuſpenſion,
let them be ſent to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
of the place for it, and
duly puniſhed. And as to
the Church-Governors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
or Vicars, or Chaplains
by the year, who for fear or
favour of men, ſetting a ſide
their awe to Heaven, do not
effectually require their tythes
aforeſaid, let themſelves be
ſuſpended till they pay a

               <p>I have both tranſcribed at length, and tranſlated this, as
I ſaid, becauſe it is the chief Law, whereupon (immediatly)
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58798:70"/>
the dueneſs of tythes is grounded and known by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non:
as to the Regulation of the manner of collecting this
prevailing, though not as to the dueneſs it ſelf; for this, as
hath been ſhewed, was ſecured before, and therefore the law
begins with ſuppoſition, and blame, that men did not Pay
as they ought, which was here intended to be remedied. And
for the ſufficient authority hereof, we need not much doubt;
for Lawyers and Men were awaked both then and ever ſince,
&amp; would not through ages and generations have been fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or cheated with meer empty ſhews of Paper Canons into
a fooliſh &amp; childiſh awe of what was but terrible. They knew
no doubt, from time to time there was ſtrength enough
(with help of former grounds) to carry things on and force
them, if any rub of oppoſition were laid in the way, which
made them pick a vertue out of that was indeed a kinde of
neceſſity, and doe with ſeeming willingneſs, what if they
would not, they muſt and might have been compelled to.
Other Conſtitutions are alſo about the ſame time, but not
of ſo great moment; yet, becauſe they have ſome force, our
niggardize ſhall not ſuppreſs what may be pleaſing, profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

Theſe three Conſtitutions (Decrees, Statutes, Laws, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
they were for payment, call them what you will,) were
in one mans time, and about the parting of <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. and <hi>Edw.</hi>
2. Raigns: which (it ſeems) did not yet ſo remedy things
as to prevent all future broyls. A thing impoſſible: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
will laſt while the world: Laws can never reach
their full intended force and operation in quieting ſtrifes, and
calming the ſtorms of mens rage and wrangling paſſions <hi>full
and wholly,</hi> but ever and anon they will break out to miſchief
and diſturbance: the Root is in our corrupt nature, which
will not but have Spring at ſome time of the year or other
to ſhoot forth and fructifie unto grief and trouble, in reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of the earth, curſed for our ſakes into a proneneſs to
weeds, and moſt Natural feracity of Briars and Thorns.
We ſhall finde this diſpoſition generally received through
the world,<note place="margin">Act. 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 35.</note> that moſt men are more quick and nimble of the
receiving hand, then of the giving, and though they be the
words of the Lord Jeſu, That it is more bleſſed to give then
to receive, yet they will take the contrary by a bold inverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and think it better howſoever for them, to Receive then
to Give. Of the ſame extent is alſo this Conſtitution of
things, That where many are to pay known dues, ſome will
bee found backward, ſtanding off as far as they dare till
neceſſity conſtrain them to come in; Which makes it a rare
inſtance but if any be to receive never ſo known dues, ſome
will fall ſhort, at leaſt there muſt be wrangling with a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and this ſhall be hardly avoided with ſome, whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hath to deal with many. A fruit of our corrupt nature;
mourn we for it in private, and ſorrowful miſchance to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of all mankind, condemned hereby to live as it were in
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58798:72"/>
fury of a tempeſt, in the flames of paſſion burning and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
to the mutual torment of One another: A great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance
of the quiet and peaceable world, and unfortunate
occaſion of many troubles to many, who being of themſelves
not diſpoſed to trouble, are yet (by the things they have to
deal with) forced beſide their nature, and by the cunning
craftineſs of thoſe that lay in wait to deceive (whoſe verſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilous
ſhifts are hard to be avoided) often put upon this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma,
of either <hi>gaining contention,</hi> or <hi>loſing right;</hi> and if
there be but one of a multitude diſpoſed to wrangle, he that
hath to deal with All, muſt oppoſe that man and bear half the
blame; and as ſuits and troubles increaſe with his unjuſt vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
his ſeeming guilt increaſes alſo. If this were not, we
ſhould have much toward a quiet and thereby happy world,
approaching the ſimplicity of the golden age, with return of
its peace, calmneſs, meekneſs, love, and a conſtant ſerenity of
all things; A bleſſing ſo highly inriching, that it ſeems the
wiſe Providence above does not think fit to truſt, or rather
tempt us with, becauſe perhaps beyond our power to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
or bear ſo great a happineſs. Which aptneſs to conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhewed it ſelf ſoon after the Canons formerly made and

clear intent of thoſe plain and well-meant Laws, ſo plain, one
would think, that there were no way left to delude or ſhift
from the meaning and purpoſe laid forth in ſuch plain and

that, the watchfull prudence of him ſate then in higheſt

The grievance on the Churches part
was<note n="1" place="margin">Tit. eod. cap. Quanquam ex ſolventibus.</note> this; That whereas leſs charge
was in manuring for Woods, and longer expectation for one

out, and the Countrey, which was worſt, had a cuſtome for
this unreaſonableneſs. No ſuch matter: The continuance
of the diſeaſe did rather call for a more ſpeedy remedy, which
it had, and therefore is firſt determined what <hi>Sylva caedua</hi>
was; <hi>Quae cujuſcunque exiſtens generis arborum in hoc ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betur

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58798:74"/>
Church to carry on what it undertook, and to make a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
Act ſtrong enough in this caſe to ſettle a temporall
ſort of things that had a touch (in that they were annexed
to, and the ſupport of Gods ſervice) of ſpirituality. (For all

men is the firm and only bottom whereupon temporal Right
and Dominion do reſt here: Men have agreed, Therefore
Thus it was; Which was here and thus compleat and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.)
If the Temporalty had not ſtirred at all, it had been

the victory might have ſeemed over their power, not
their Right, and ſo the uſe of their diſcretion to have ſtayed
for their right and moved by their power for it, in a time
when they were likely to obtain: But ſith they ſtirred, and
obtained, and had redreſs reall and effectuall, A ſigne they

ſign that in other things they let ſilently and quietly paſs:

the Juriſdictions here ſevered and cut out as it were imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
and by a thread; nor could a more proper and formal
eſſential difference have been found out between the one
and the other then this, That the one did handle <hi>De jure

things of This world, and the other of the reſt, and tythes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the reſt.</p>
               <p>Which lets us fitly onward to the other, the <hi>Executive</hi>
part of theſe <hi>Legiſlatives</hi> hitherto, and how they had their
force in the proper place deſigned thereunto for recovery of
theſe things thus made Due and ſtated according to theſe
Laws; but hereof I have not much to ſay. I was always a
ſtranger to their proceedings, nor as to gain or loſe, did I
ever do or ſuffer, what might import favour or wrong, to be
thereby holpen or hindred at any time; Onely this I have
heard ſpoke out by the clear and loud fame of the world, That
here mens rights were tried, and examined, and loſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered:
Pleas were heard, and ſentence given, and that
ſentence did, or ſhould, or might have found obedience.
If all had not been right and ſquare, as we ſay, exactly juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable,
If there had been any remedy at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> or any
where elſe that could have been thought of, If the Goddeſs
<hi>Themis</hi> had had any Aſylum or refuge upon Earth whereunto
covetous and carnal men might have had recourſe in their
fears, with any hopes of protection in thoſe affrighting tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts,
that like ſome kinde of lightning melted their gold and
ſilver in their purſes, yea, out of their purſes, No doubt but
ſuch deſired ſhelter would have been made to with greateſt
diligence and trueſt endeavour: Queſtionleſs in what dark
or remote corner ſoever it had hid it ſelf above ground, men
would have both ſought it carefully, and found it ſucceſsfully:
Undoubtedly every one man would have told his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:58798:75"/>
and he another, theſe more, and by degrees all; The
information would ſo ſoon and luckily have propagated it ſelf,
that no manner of doubt ſhould now have remained, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuch a place had been or not; the path would have been
more trodden to it, then to any Church or Market-place in
<hi>England:</hi> But they knew there was none ſuch, They knew
all was there, of this nature, (while it was,) firm and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable;
They knew thoſe ſentences were there (in their
kinde,) by the approbation of all men, and Authority of the
Law, valid as thoſe at <hi>Westminſter, Pulſa dignoſcere cautus,
quid ſolidum crepet:</hi> They knew, Try whoſo would, There
was that ſolidity. Civil Laws did approve, ſucceſſions of
Parliament had allowed, the King had given leave, the whole
State had given allowance of thoſe proceedings, and above
all, the Law held them juſt and according to Law: And ſo
unleſs her ſelf would contradict her ſelf, the head fall off
from a principall member, or Juſtice oppoſe Righteouſneſs,
They (all the Magiſtrates, Powers, Laws, and Lawyers of
<hi>England</hi>) knew, and could not but pronounce a juſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
in that Court for Tythes to be juſt: were it for ſheaf,
lamb, fruit, veniſon, the tenth Thrave, or but a Tythe-lock
of wooll; What a ſentence did at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> that a decree
did there; What a Verdict and Judgement upon an Aſſiſe,
That a concluſive determination upon mature deliberation did
here; and What ſufficient ground of Right that gave of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
that a man might thence claim a piece of ground or
debt of money, <hi>Hic codex eſt meus, Haec domus eſt veſtra,</hi> By
equall vertue of a like ſentence here, this due charged upon
every parcel of land or herd of Cattle had declared right,
yea, and judgement for it, in order to execution; Or if any
would not come and ſubmit, <hi>vocetur primò, &amp; ſecundò, &amp;
quòd ſi nec ſic ad emendationem venerit, Excommunicetur,</hi> as
<hi>tertiò;</hi> leave was given in the Charter.</p>
               <p>Thus as to the power intruſted with the Church, I have
now almoſt done; we ſee what the Supream Authority gave
in Commiſſion, we ſee what uſe was made of it, we ſee what
connivence or more there was of all other powers, and what
obedience likely; but of this the leſs being unacquainted at
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58798:76"/>
Offices: We cannot in ſhort doubt but the Church made
Laws about Tythes, that they cauſed them to be done to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
that the State inabled them, that the whole Civill
Power more then connived or permitted, appointed, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed,
and ſtrengthned that power whereby was acted thus
according to office and duty on one part, and leave, deſire,
expectation, and full truſt on the other: The reſult of all
doubtleſs a full right, a clear, aſſured, undoubted, faſt, ſafe
and honeſt title, as good as Any had to Any thing, and the
evidence of things may diſcharge the ſuperfluity of more waſt
words; If any right were anywhere, it may doubtleſs be
reaſonably thought to have been unavoidably, <hi>Here, Sure,</hi>
and <hi>Thus.</hi> There remains yet one onely thing more, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
in intention, was never quickned to full Act, but was
purpoſed to give much in little, the life, ſpirits, and vertue
of all before in the new intended to be purified Canon Law
by <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. authority. A thing often glanced at, but here fit
to be repreſented together, and briefly and ſummarily was
therefore thus: The<note n="1" place="margin">25 Hen 8 19.</note> Clergy upon caſting off the yoak
of forain Supremacy, and ſubmitting to that King, petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to have the Provinciall Synods and all the Canon Law as
far as of force here, to be viewed and purged, and this to be
done by thirty two perſons to be choſen by the King, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ſixteen of the Temporalty, ſixteen of the Clergy. The
King granted readily what perhaps he had willed to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and the perſons were to be members of the preſent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
but becauſe ſo great a wheel could not be brought
about in ſo little time, the Parliament ſitting, their deſires
inlarged, were alſo granted, that it might be done after, and
then ſo many Canons as ſhould continue approved, ſhould
be retained, the reſt as refuſe caſt away. This was upon the
matter to furniſh the Spirituall Court with a new rule, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
as much of the old as would ſhould have ſerved the turn
again but till that were done, what was in being to remain.
and this ſo farre intended and minded, even with an eye
to this very particular, that after when a<note n="2" place="margin">Provided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and be it ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Authority aforeſaid, that this Act for Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of Tythes, ne any thing therein contained, ſhall take force &amp; effect, but only untill ſuch time as the Kings Highneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

remove the obſtructions, and ſcoure the wheels up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which ſuits moved, ſtill leaving the thing they found, they
needed adde no more, but ſay, Thoſe rights ſhall be paid

to adde an apple or an aye more, as that Poet ſaid, which I

and would not have done for God or man. No not for
Religion, which needs not injuſtice, or that any be put out
of his Right for Gods ſake; And God be thanked, as things
are, and the world has been devout heretofore and devoted,
it needs not; Let but God and man have their Due, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion

fruitfull beneficence, and the good will of men ſhall move
Mountains this way; But let the Law of the Goſpel have

can or need do for its outward ſuſtentation by what was done
for it before our fathers were born. Well: this plotted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation

               <p>It might have been convenient to have repreſented here
a full tranſcription of theſe things; but there is intimation
where they may be had for uſe, which may be enough, where
brevity is ſtudied. Theſe Proviſions of a Law ſhew clearly
what the ſtate then meant, as to Reformation, and even in
this particular (if the purpoſe of the ſtatute had been obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for aboliſhing the old Canons,) and how inviolable the
right of Tythes ſhould have been Then by their profound
wiſdome and diſcreet piety, which is alſo better ſeen by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
from theſe publick conſultations then any private infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations.
The reſults they were of a ſevere and ſearching re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
wherein as many ſtones had been moved (hoping
thereby to ſettle others) as in any tumbling Age; and for
the diſtreſſed Church what men durſt do, if it had been jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
convenient, needs no other demonſtration then what was
done: But profound wiſdome joyned with much piety, and
a conſcionable regard (proceeding in the fear of God) not
to deſtroy what they meant to reform, or to purge out cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
humours to the death of the patient, made them ſoberly
carefull we ſee, and tenderly jealous not to meddle too far
here, and for fear of darkneſs over all diſcreetly adviſed to let
none of the oyle be medled with that kept the Pariſh Lamp
burning, but rather gave hope of adding more where need
was, (with encouragement to bring it in,) ſetting open a
door to let in other ſupplies of needfull expence for theſe
Lamps diſperſed all abroad, if God ſhould ſo move the hearts
of thoſe that loved the Tabernacle and the light thereof, to
bring any offering; To ſtrip all having been a thought of ſuch
horrid injuſtice and barbarous impiety, joyned with Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
(as to Religion) and imprudence into the bargain,
that in likelihood truth might have been in danger of periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the earth by this time, and according to ordinary
diſpenſations of Providence, we have now had little enough of
Law or Goſpel to take up conſultations for the maintenance
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:58798:78"/>
of, by that the Bible might have been near a ſtranger, if this
had prevailed: But into their ſoft and tender boſomes, by
the Grace of God, ſuch thoughts had not leave and power
to enter.</p>
               <p>Why the tree thus planted hath not been known to bear
fruit, or this new body thus framed, not received to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
by, is, I ſaid, hard to gueſs; the beſt reaſon I can think
of is for want of Parliamentary allowance and ſubſequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,
for nought elſe ſee I wanting: yet as ſtrange that
what a Parliament had appointed to be done, and being done,
and accordingly, ſhould not have therewith what ſtrength it
could give. But ſo it has been, a dead letter hitherto, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
living in the good wiſhes of knowing good men, that it
were quickned to full life, and the laſt Eccleſiaſticall piece
(I call it ſo in regard of the <hi>Materia prima,</hi> out of which it
was made, the end whereat it aimed, the things it directs
about, and its diſtinct ſtanding off from the more common or
ſecular,) that, of this kinde, our Common-wealth hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded:
Not unfitly reduced to this head of Eccleſiaſtick,
whoſe proceedings have been ſuch by vertue of due power
throughout this buſineſs, that it needs no protection of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbole
to excuſe that all have either liked or willed;
Kings, States, Parliaments, Judges, Lord, Laws, not ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their vote of approbation, (to this particular ſtill I mean)
and all that have, have looked on either to allow or confirm.
With this one intimation more I cloſe up the point, that
wheras this new body is not yet it ſeems authoriſed perfectly,
till it ſhal be, All the old (including thoſe alſo I made uſe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
are in force by a concluding Proviſo of that firſt ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
(25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. 19.) where the whole buſineſs was ſtarted.
The words are theſe: <q>
                     <hi>Provided alſo, that ſuch Canons,
Conſtitutions, Ordinances, and Synodals Provincial,
being already made, which be not contrariant nor repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

in praejudicium libertatis Eccleſiaſticae.</hi> Which things may
together ſhew fully enough, what the breach of Franchiſe
was, and by conſequent what the Franchiſe it ſelf, by the beſt
which is publick interpretation: Whence alſo likelieſt this
was the meaning of the Grant: That the Church have all
her Rights, that is, Tythes (with others) intire: and all
her Franchiſes, that is, Juriſdiction, (Decimal, as for other
things, to bring them in,) Inviolable; no leſs then which
could be meant by any likely conſtruction. Or otherwiſe
Thus; and the ſtrength of this title may here have received
two ways augmentation. 1. As Tythes were a Right and
ſo warranted and intended to remain ſuch. 2. As they came
within the compaſs of Eccleſiaſticall Juriſdiction, which, if
they were given before, and any Law had aſſured them, (as
many had doubtleſs,) This was then here allowed to bring
them in: And ſo were it perſonall or praediall, lamb or wooll,
ſheaf or heap, muſt not now then have been withholden,
but were due, and muſt be paid, yea, by the great Charter,
yea, while that Charter was in force, could not be denyed, for
that herein were confirmed, to the Church all her Rights
(Tythes) intire, All her Liberties, (Juriſdiction, Decimal)
inviolable; and Wrong muſt have been to deprive her of
thoſe Rights, (of theſe Tythes,) of this Franchiſe, (of that
Juriſdiction) Or otherwiſe laſtly, Thus: Let but the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction,
that Liberty, be ſuppoſed to have remained, and
this would bring in all the reſt: For, let the Church but have
been heard to ſpeak out in that which ſome accounted then
doubtleſs as things were (in a qualified ſenſe) the voice of
God, which was the voice of the Law, and this could have
ſpoken out nothing but roundly and home for Tythes: For
they were Due, then Due, and ſo Due: Let that dead
letter be then but thus have been quickned by lively ſentence,
and the Law be heard ſpeak out according to truth and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
and the voice could be nothing elſe but for deſired
Juſtice, Truth, and Them.</p>

                  <hi>worthy of double honour, labouring ſtill in the word

their right, be it much or little, and Who or Whatſoever:
But is this ſort of men Onely inconſiderable, to be ſhut out
of door when right is diſtributing, and they alone are Chidden
if they ask their Due, or expect their Right from the Petition
of Right, and the every man elſe inriching Charter: <hi>Heu
quòd literulas stulti docuêre parentes!</hi> Nay, will they not
blame their calling that deprives them of common equity, and
ſhuts them out from the open Hall of Juſtice, and they may
not claim their due in Every ones Inheritance? It grieves
me to conſider, and I wonder it ſhould be ſo: The ſame
men that urge thoſe publick Conceſſions ſo earneſtly, and
would ſuffer more rather then loſe any of their little ſhares in
this univerſal Grant, yet cry out againſt Tythes without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
or meaſure, take on and complain as of a burden
inſupportable, and when their own parts are taken out, They
may not be reſtrained of their liberty or abridged of their
property, (God forbid they ſhould;) Other mens right or
liberties, they may be ſtamped under feet, their Dues are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable,
no dear Own by their Property. I hope and
believe they have been hitherto but miſtaken in judgement,
and thinking Tythes to be no other but the impoſitions of
ſome later ſtatutes, or the uſurpations of the Conſiſtory;
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:58798:84"/>
no wonder or blame they would have tyranny aboliſhed, and
exactions removed, that every man may enjoy his dear Own,
and no man uſurp upon his neighbour in any the ſmalleſt
matter: But would they conſider what deep and ſettled, and
al over-ſpread radication theſe claims have in all the Civil laws
of the land; How the Parliament allowes them, the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Right involves them, the Canon gave them, the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
confirmed them, the Common Law ſet them up; and
all the Politicks of the Nation combine and conjoyn their
ſtrength for their legal Dueneſs, as of Any thing: Could
they look (paſt ſome ſingle Order or Act,) into the depth
of <hi>that diffuſed and far-ſpreading Rule and Giver of all Right
with us, the Soveraign Law,</hi> and there finde that what
gives all men right in this Nation, gives here with as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
aſſurance, and a manifold accumulation of more
ſtrength and evidence, They would then, I truſt, change their
notes, or as the word uſes to be, ſing us another ſong; They
would not betray their diſcretion to ſuch neceſſary diſgrace
as muſt follow upon their deſtroying with one hand, what
but now they had ſet up with the other, nor would they take
away w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> their left what they gave with their right; but Right,
and Charter, and Liberty, and Property, ſhould be all of a
ſort, and one mans claim of any thing from or by any of Them
as good as anothers. Could they eſpy (that which is) an
involved title in theſe publick evidences they contend for,
and theſe Dues to be as certainly implied in the Charter (as
they are) as their own inheritances; They would no doubt
ſoon change their Engliſh mindes in a contrary way to the

of your honeſty and ſimplicity a ſtrong patronage of that
righteous cauſe now in ignorance and by miſtake ye go about
to ſuppreſs, and that ye would appear valiant, yea ſuffering
Champions for that equity and right, ye now ſeem reſolved
to take pains, if not to ſuffer, rather then permit any longer
thoſe that have right to enjoy. Let but a love to truth, and
conſtancy to your own principles be with you, and I have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
I petition, I ask no more. Nor do I altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair;
As great changes have been in the world, and faces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
from Weſt to Eaſt, quite contrary to what was once
perſecuted or proſecuted in ignorance. The two Theeves
ſhamed not to confeſs the truth at laſt: (I equall you not

ſize or uſe. 4. In deſpite of any Law to the contrary;
Then, 1. here be tythes, which were then due by Law: 2.

in conſideration of the Then ſtate of things,) by vertue
of the Law, and by vertue of this Law, for that herein were
granted all Laws and Liberties. Remove to <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. and

                  <hi>Articuli Cleri,</hi> and ſo
not like to afford nothing; but Engliſhed, Articles<note n="2" place="margin">In the old edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of 1543.</note> for
the Clergy, and ſo like to afford ſomething for them. The
firſt thus propoſes and reſolves: <hi>Whereas Lay-men doe
purchaſe Prohibitions generally upon tythes obventions, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
mortuaries, &amp;c. The King doth anſwer, that in
tythes, oblations, obventions, and mortuaries</hi> (when they are
propounded under theſe names) <hi>the Kings Prohibition ſhal
hold no place, although for the long withholding the ſame,
the monie may be eſtèemed at a ſum certain. But if a Clerk
ſell his tythes gathered into his barn for monie, &amp;c.</hi> then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.
And if the Kings Prohibition ſhould not lay any
impediment, but things muſt be tried by the Canons, we know
and are aſſured whether tended, and what that meant. But
more particularly here obſerve, 1. That the power which is
known would give them in, is here, without diſlike mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
2. Plainly allowed. 3. As to tythes by name. 4. Stren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gthened;
By this that as in <hi>Circumspectè agatis</hi> no diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
ſhould be offered by the ſecular Judge impeading to
proceed in their own way. 5. And all this by Parliament,
Sending the trial where beforehand it was known how the
buſineſs would go; And then, as if the ſupream power ſend
a criminall offendor to the Bar of Criminals, knowing how
the caſe will there go, looking on, permitting, and acquieſcing
in the ſentence there to follow upon that ſending; They more
then ſeem to confirm and allow, whatever prove the iſſue; ſuch
interpretation may reaſonably be made here of the remiſſion
of theſe caſes, and the temporal power could not but be
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:58798:88"/>
thought to own the event, and what was done whether them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſent for trial. The proviſions were as ſtrict as well they
could to hinder extravagancy, for, as treading in the ſteps of
the <hi>Regia Prohibitio</hi> before, if once the thing were never ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
converted to ſeem temporal, Away with it preſently, Grant
it no longer protection here, but allow ſuit for it whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
But if it remained, <hi>ſpirituale vel spirituali annexum,</hi> it
ſelf, As reaſon would and the nature of the thing required;
the King ſays, the Law ſays, the Parliament ſays, and all,
let the Church have her due; If it be to try theſe things and
bring them home to her own houſe, let no envious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment
grudge her right, no not though by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of time the things have run ſo long, as they may ſeem
to have degenerated into a Lay-commodity. <hi>Chap. 2. Alſo if
debate ariſe upon the right of Patronage, and the Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

other had a clauſe to keep them inviolable by the late Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
determination of 2 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. 13. in the end.</p>
               <p>Follows next <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. and here we have more: In every
K. Raign almoſt ſomewhat, if but for recognition, and to
ſhew that that peece agreed with the whole. As firſt, There
had been over-lookers, as before, of the Juriſdiction Chriſtian,
who diſturbed, and diſcouraged, (but they did but over-look
and hinder, not abſolutely take away; the thing remained,
and hence proved.) Alſo ſome that pulled away a branch
or bough rather from the tree, hindering by <hi>Scire facias</hi>
from the Chancery the triall of Diſmes from its proper Court:
The King in the Statute for the Clergy before mentioned,
gives remedy for both in the two laſt Chapters of that Act.
Chap.<note place="margin">18 Edw. 3.</note> 6. <hi>Item, <hi>Whereas Commiſſions be newly made to
divers Juſtices, that they ſhall make inquiry upon Judges
of holy Church,</hi>
                  </hi> &amp;c. But the whole was tranſcribed before,
whereto I therefore remit. Mark chiefly that clauſe, that
<hi>Cauſes teſtamentarie and others, did notoriouſlie belong to
the Cognizance of Holy Church,</hi> and the King ſaid ſo.
Not <hi>Rob. Winchelſee,</hi> or <hi>Jo. Stratforth,</hi> or any of the paſt or
then preſent Church-Miniſters, who did no more then they
had power; but the King: Nor did they incroach, ſaith He;
It was rather Then an incroachment upon them to interpoſe
and trouble the orderly motion of their wheels tending to
a juſt adminiſtration of things and giving every man his due
in a way allowed by all the power that then was above, and
publick. Chap. 7. <hi>Item, <hi>Whereas Writs of</hi> Scire facias
<hi>have béen granted to warn Prelates, religious, and other
Clerks to anſwer Diſmes in our Chancery, and to ſhew,
if they have any thing, or can any thing ſay, wherefore
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:58798:89"/>
ſuch Diſmes ought not to be reſtored to the ſaid Deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,
and to anſwer as well to us, as to the parties of ſuch
Diſmes: that ſuch Writs from henceforth be not granted,
and that the parties be diſmiſſed from the ſecular Judges of
ſuch manner of pleas. Saving to us our right, ſuch as we &amp;
our anceſtors have had and were wont to have of reaſon.</hi>
                  </hi>
God forbid elſe, and that whether Supream or Temporal
power ſhould be abridged of its due by any dependant or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour:
for the Charet never moves ſo well as when every
wheel keeps its proper place, and every power does its own
work without any others troubleſome let or interpoſition. A
wen in the body, or any monſtrous excreſcence (beſides that
it deforms the whole) robs the other parts, and none is ſo
much pleaſured with what is ſuperabundant, as the reſt is
diſpleaſured by following neceſſary defect: The injury of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
member redounds to the prejudice of the whole body; And
the Common-wealth flouriſheth ſo proſperouſly never, as
when every limbe acts for it ſelfe, every member does its own
office, the head, foot, hand, eye or other part command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
obeying, ruling, or being ruled as it ought, and none
uſurps or launcheth out over-buſily into that of cure which
belongs in proper deſign to another. Here it was meant ſo:
and therefore, <hi>Saving to the whether Supream or Temporal
power, what did belong thereto,</hi> the appearance upon the <hi>Scire
facias</hi> is diſcharged. Can any thing be more plain? And if
ſuch inquiries had been uſed to be made in the Court of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
(as this Statute implies) Then, and muſt be there, and
were here ſent thither by the Parliament, And They when
things came thither, ſaid the tenth ſheaf, fleece, colt, or
lamb was due. Can any thing be more certain then that it
was ſo done even by their <hi>recognition,</hi> aſſent, and purpoſed
appointment, and ought accordingly to be paid? Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
did, had an unequall task to ſtruggle againſt, the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Law, and Soveraign power that made Right, if he would
go on yet waywardly to contend. The Law is, as<note n="1" place="margin">Heb. 6. 16.</note> Gods

men had to ſay for any thing, how vain muſt they be,
who would contend, that were thus concluded before they
began, and all-ruling oracles of Law rightly ſought, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>About three years before,<note place="margin">15 Edw. 3. cap. 6.</note> in this Kings Raign there was
a repealed Seſſion, part whereof is made to look this way: The
words are theſe. <hi>Item, <hi>It is accorded that the Miniſters of
holy Church for monie taken for redemption of corporal pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
nor for proof and account of Teſtaments, or for
travail taken about the ſame, nor for ſolemnitie of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
nor for other things touching the Juriſdiction of holy
Church, ſhall not be impeached or arreſted, nor driven
to anſwer before the Kings Juſtices, nor other Miniſters,
but have Writs from the Chancery for diſcharge, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </hi> which
I finde conſtrued in favour of tythes:<note place="margin">By Sir <hi>Tho. Ril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley:</hi> in his view of the Laws, <hi>par 3. c. 2. ſect. 1 pa.</hi> 143.</note> But becauſe it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
ſoon after, and doubtful when it was in being, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
poſſible ſenſes of the words leading the grantors minde
to look (not improbably on either part) two ways; I paſs it
over, and come to the Statute of <hi>Sylva caedua,</hi> which was ſure
to the purpoſe, at leaſt by conſequent. It was made indeed
againſt<note n="1" place="margin">45 Edw. 3. c 5</note> ſome exactions of tythes, yet ſo as it implies for
other; The by-blow ſets up to rights what the direct had
pulled down, and By ſaying Some ſhould not be paid, The
reſt it ſhould ſeem Should; For a Prohibition allowed to
take place for trees of twenty years growth, and no more,
ſeems to whiſper and ſuggeſt that in others it ſhall not, or
the reſt is left to courſe of ordinary proceeding. The words
were given<note n="2" place="margin">Pa. 137.</note> before, not needful to be repeated again,
and the moſt of practiſe and the regulation of things has been,
I beleeve accordingly. Laws are commonly like two-edged
ſwords, they cut both ways: If they ſay <hi>This,</hi> they mean
<hi>That;</hi> If they give the Negative, they imply the Affirmative;
If one in prohibition, the other to permiſſion; If they ſay,
a thing ſhall be hindered, and ſo far, they imply farther hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
is not meant, but the thing as to the reſt is left at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
Foraſmuch then as the Canon gave tythe of all (grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and renewing) and the Statute, finding fault with ſome
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:58798:90"/>
of the latitude, gave order to prohibit but of twenty years
growth; the reſtraint of this ſize is implication that liberty is
left to the reſt, and the hindering <hi>but ſo far</hi> that in the reſt
was ſcope; Which being for the tenth Faggot, Heap, or
Cord, the Juriſdiction thereof, yea the Law thereof, and
thereby Right is not a little hereby, nor obſcurely furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and ratified. Or otherwiſe obſerve, as before, two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things:
Firſt, <hi>Lex terrae</hi> did here interpoſe, and when
any thing paſſed the Synod, the State could not brook,
This 's power controuled That 's Canons, which hindred
the Right of Tythes effectuall from going any farther then
the Crown Law would allow. Secondly, but in that which
was <hi>Sylva caedua</hi> properly, or Copp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ce-wood, this interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
was not, but the other power left at liberty (known to
reſolve as before) Therefore there was ſtill a connivence, and
ſo far conſent and approbation, and ſo this Law was firſt
<hi>againſt Tythes,</hi> is ſecondly <hi>for them;</hi> at firſt hand <hi>againſt
Some,</hi> at ſecond <hi>for Others,</hi> And affording but a prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

to me moſt authentique, and as a publick Act, more ſafe
ground of opinions then any private thinkings, which I
would make uſe of onely in defect of thoſe) and it is againſt
multiplying Prohibitions upon Prohibitions: Corrupt pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe

brought in, that a<note n="2" place="margin">So averred and complained in the articles exhibited to the Privy Councel, 3 <hi>Iaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi, in Mich. Ter. Object. 5 Cook Inſtit. 4. p.</hi> 603.</note> ſucceſſion to five or ſixe genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

upon grievous Complaint made to him this Parliament,
hath perceived that the Religious men of the Order of</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteaux

and derogation of the Libertie of holy Church, and of many
Liege people of the Realm: our Lord the King willing
thereunto to ordain Remedie, by the advice and aſſent of the
Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and at the inſtance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of the ſaid Commons hath ordained and ſtabliſhed,
that the Religious Perſons of the Order of</hi> Ciſteaux <hi>ſhall
ſtand in the ſtate that they were before the time of ſuch
Buls purchaſed: And that as well they of the ſaid Order,
as all other Religious and Seculars, of what eſtate and
condition that they be, which do put the ſaid Bulls in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or from henceforth do purchaſe other ſuch Bulls of new,
or by colour of the ſame Bulls purchaſed or to be purchaſed,
do take advantage in any manner, That Proceſſe ſhall be
made againſt them, and every of them by garniſhment of two
moneths by Writ of</hi> Praemunire facias. <hi>And if they make
default or be attainted, then they ſhall incur the pains and
forfeitures conteined in the Statute of Proviſors, made in
the 13 Richard</hi> 2. Done in the Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> in
the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tas</hi> of <hi>S. Hillary;</hi> and we have by it a notable evidence
of the King and Kingdoms good will and allowance of the
continuance of theſe Rights, that they would not ſuffer them
to be curtolled or kept back unpaid, not by virtue of an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from <hi>Rome,</hi> (whoſe power how great it then was, all
know) but willed rather a <hi>Praemunire</hi> againſt the Detainers,
Perverters, and their Adherents and Aſſiſters: The reſt did,
ſo ſhould they ſet out their Dues, as of Right and accuſtomed;
A ſtrong evidence they were due indeed, when the State
would not ſuffer them unpaid! Now not onely theſe but ſome
others, it ſeems were wavering or ſhifting: The Fermours of
Aliens gave within few years after occaſion to this Vote.

Theſe had any ſpeciall Obligation to a Rule by themſelves

It is not without the compaſs of manly and Chriſtian fear
to be jealous, leſt the light and brightneſs of the glorious
Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, (now ſhining in the faces of all men,
though not reaching to their hearts, it is much to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

Earth by our negligence and parcimony, though his Deity
we truſt ſhine now in Heaven, and ſhall, and ever, above
the brightneſs of the Sun, and beyond all Eternity. Wee
hold God to be the end of the ſoul, Truth the way leading
to it and Him; The Church the pillar and ground of truth, to

and the whole frame muſt be left to ſink and ruine with it for
want of ſuſtenance, or underſuſtentation: Unleſs by an
unhallowed preſumption we dare go on Tempting God in
ſtead of Truſting him, ſtill urging him to do, and expecting

and leading him once more out of the way into the
Wilderneſs, to lead us out of the path of his ordinary courſe
of Providence to expect food from Heaven, when there is
plenty enough upon Earth: Which if, and the boldneſs of
our unreaſonable preſumption rather then well-inſtructed
Chriſtian faith, could be content to put upon Him, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>Thus then this Politick and herein wiſe and juſt Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
and accordingly gave his minde in ſundry Acts paſſing
his ſeal. The firſt whereof (clear enough in it ſelf, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentially
much to our purpoſe) was in cutting off Appeals
from hence to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo making this Iſland-Church (as
having no dependance of abroad,) a perfect Independent
Congregation. For ſo it was then judged moſt expedient;
that the affairs of <hi>Judea</hi> ſhould not be ſent neceſſarily to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi>
or <hi>Babylon; Jeruſalem</hi> might conclude all controverſies
that aroſe in the Land where <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was, and our Kings
Crown being of Circular and thereby moſt capacious form,
was large enough to involve and comprehend under it a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of all thoſe difficulties might ariſe under it; And
that Therefore all doubts ſhould be referred to him, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all forain Appeals ſhould ceaſe, Whereupon ordered
and ſet forth as followeth:<note place="margin">24 Hen. 8. cha. 12</note> 1. That this of <hi>England</hi> was
an intire Monarchy: 2. Had ſuffered prejudice by appeals
to abroad ſo long, as in Cauſes Teſtamentary, of Tythes, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
&amp;c. 3. It ſhould be ſo no more, but even thoſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
(of Tythes again expreſſed,) be here put to a period:
And therefore, 4. Enacted, <hi>That All cauſes teſtamentary,
cauſes of matrimony and divorce, Rights of Tythes, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
and Obventions, (the knowledge whereof by the
goodneſſe of Princes of this Realm, and by the Laws and
Cuſtomes of the ſame appertaineth to the Spiritual Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of this Realm,</hi>) (mark that Parentheſis, and the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:58798:96"/>
weight thereof, and this engraven in the inſide of a Law, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferted
into the heart of an Act of Parliament, to give the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
certainty of credit, and the thing as much aſſurance
to us, as any thing we have, without the Bible; that all ſuch
cauſes, I ſay,) <hi>already commenced, or happening hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
&amp;c. ſhall be examined, diſcuſſed, and definitively deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
as the nature of any of the things aforeſaid
ſhall require,</hi> (here at home,) With power, command and
threat to all to do their duty; Appeals to whom they ſhall
be made; and from whom; and where the finall deciſion
ſhall reſt; and All in All the Branches before ſpecified: Which
does as much as any one Parliament Law can eſtabliſh and
aſſure the then power of the Church, and thereby her fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Acts, (even about Tythes expreſſed and by name,) and
by conſequent the Right and Property that ſhould be at any
time the reſult and fruit of all: Which muſt amount to we
know what.</p>
               <p>In the next year we have more of the ſame nature, in that
concluding Proviſo of 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. 19. (before mentioned)
about keeping life in the body of the Provincials (for a while,
and till the new could be made) when the Pope the ſeeming
Head of them was taken off. All know what dependance
had been, and both to compoſition and execution, what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
were formerly derived from that forain power upon
thoſe Laws: When the Head is cut off, the lower Nerves uſe
(and by conſequent limbs) to loſe all power and motion for
want of intercourfe with the brain wherein they were root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
which might be feared or doubted here reaſonably, and
this made it neceſſary to infuſe a new life of power that
ſhould ſerve (as then intended,) for a while, to quicken
the old body, till a new ſhould be framed by choſen work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to fit the King better, as to making and execution de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
ſolely on his authority. Accordingly done. The
mentioned Proviſo ratifies <hi>all Canons, Conſtitutions, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
and Synodals,</hi> till the thirty two ſhould have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
effectually: If they have ſo done, we have gained
enough, (even to this particular,) and<note n="1" place="margin">Pag. 145.</note> ſhewed how be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
If not, this Howſoever we have gotten, that the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:58798:97"/>
ſtrength that is in the Provincials, all of them, Thoſe for
Tythes before, and all other, (ſave what ſince revoked, as
about Tythes nothing has) ſtands firm and faſt by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Conſtitution, and the evident ſenſe of the words is to
the purpoſe of theſe things unavoidable.</p>
               <p>But if both theſe be yet remote, or not ſo fully home,
wrapping things onely in implying generals (or conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
that take in Tythes but implicitly wherein by deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(which is always to us fallible) may be miſtake; Come
we next to that which principally and fully, and in its finall
and clear utmoſt ſcope intends and expreſſes Dueneſs, yea,
Makes it, and where the words of the Law give the utmoſt
any order can, a purpoſed Right and way for Recovery.
Where is that? When the Cloiſters went down and the
whole Eccleſiaſtical ſtate was thereby troubled not a little in
27 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. Then was it needful, and Then was it done; and
Then the right of theſe dues eſtabliſhed, intended to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall.
How appears this? By the Statute made the ſame

by the way) as it is among the next that are neareſt on this

moſt mens weakneſs of ſight is able to diſcern or reach to

and other painfull and labourſome means uſual of
ſearching and gaining the truth, they work not beyond the
ſphere of their power and ability, making able and fitting
judgement of thoſe things, they have not the plain and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

be ſo able and prepared to judge. They are reputed Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
if they can little more then turn an Almanack, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
ſome plain Engliſh Authour, or but have ſeen a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
and then, as the <hi>Aborigines</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> which born and
bred there, travailed never far from their ſimple homes, but
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:58798:97"/>
wonder at all abroad which ſtrangers tell them; Or, as ſome
ſimple Ruſticks, who uſed to behold only the hils that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
the valleys where they live, think them to be near the end
of the world; if any thing be ſhewed them done beyond the
mountains, they dare ſcarce believe a part, and will reſt much
perſwaded that, whatever travellers tell them, is, (though they
ſay, what we have heard and ſeen, declare we unto you,) lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
better then well-compoſed fables. For they walk by ſenſe,
and not by faith, or that little faith they have, is confined
to the things of their own narrow hemiſpheres; Even ſo

                  <hi>Jewiſh</hi> incredulity <hi>they will not

is beyond the narrow compaſs of their very ſhort reach, and
not much caring if all other ſuperfluities (they eſteem them
ſo, becauſe they are not able to judge of them) were buried
in the pit of utter forgetfulneſs: As little conſidering that
their foundations have foundations, and thoſe yet again o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and other, and under, and yet farther under, and take
away either, or the advantage and ſtay of either; the readieſt
way is taking to ſtir all, to unſettle the firmeſt, to tumble
down the higheſt, to leave order, happineſs, peace, and
wealth, buried under a heap of rubbiſh, and the fair piles we
now behold and enjoy, even All the fruits of an orderly and
adviſed diſpoſition of things intombed under the ſcattered
fragments of its own ruine and very confuſion. For old things
are not to be caſt away without poſſible inconveniences to
new; the foundations unſeen, are ſtill a part of the fair buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
yea, do ſupport it; and take away the loweſt, the next
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:58798:98"/>
ſtill ſinks of any thing, and by degrees All; Even ſo take
away the firſt ſettling Laws, the under-praeſtructions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
things had their <hi>firſt ſettling</hi> compoſition and ſtay, the
reſt totters, and may expect ere long ruine in a State; Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
for tythes, their faſteſt and moſt ſolid ſtrength ſeems
below in the old unſeen acts of gift and firſt diſpoſition; the
new can be never but a fair and preſently uſeful declaration,
to ſet out uttermoſt to the ſight of the world, and as the
paint that ſhines for people to gaze upon; the ſtrength of the
wall and houſe both is in the incloſed materials and rocky
foundation. Yet becauſe theſe are of great eſtimation with
the multitude, and ought indeed to be of ſome with All, I
ſhall not ſhun to give them intire, in the opinion of the many
enough to create a right, if nought elſe were, as if nought
elſe were, perhaps they might: But as now things ſtand, are
ſo far from doing it effectually and onely, that they do it
not in any degree; Any more then if a preſent Act ſhould be
made about Fines and Relieves, the next age might think
it gave the Lord that Right we know he enjoys already; Or,
as a new Act about Quit-rents and Herriots ſhould be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to raiſe or warrant the things no man but knows had
right before; (The moſt in addition any new order can doe
being but to rectifie, diſpoſe, or ſettle ſome new courſe about
the things ſo due already, that 'tis that injury comes near a
Theft, to ſubtract or deny the juſt payment of them:) So the
following later Statutes nor do, nor can any more but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive,
quicken and eſtabliſh the ancient right of tythes, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
and of long being before,) awaken mens dulneſs, inforce
their payment, remove obſtructions that have grown in by
corruption with time, and make that which is ſhine brighter
and fairer by the fourbiſhing over of a new and freſh autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
Their dueneſs being that theſe ſtatutes did never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to meddle with, infringe, further, help, nor hinder, but
they were what they were before; and it were one of the moſt
pitiful pieces of Ignorance befitting onely the Vulgar heard
of unlettered Simplicians, and deſerving rather commiſerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
then the exerciſe of any of our manly paſſions to entertain
a thought to or toward the contrary. What! that theſe later
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:58798:98"/>
Statutes created tythes! Made them due! Gave them! that
their abrogation ſhould have a poſſibility of taking them <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way!</hi>
and what the ſervice of God has to truſt to by virtue
of their promulgation! This is ſuch a ſhallow conceit is onely
worthy the weak brains of the multitude, where onely it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
could be hatched or can be tolerated or indured; no
more excuſable then if any ſhould ſay, <hi>Aristotles</hi> Aſtronomy

firſt ſet up Game, or a preſent Law, if it ſhould diſpoſe of, did

by themſelves: nor to hinder any remedy by due prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor any thing to continue longer then till the new
Canon ſhould be made, which is not yet done, and whereof
before enough. Mark the whole Tenour; Is here any
thing of giving Tythes? Of wronging any man of a Farthing
by a new and forced Impoſition? Of removing from one to
ſettle on another? To enrich <hi>Peter</hi> by taking from <hi>Paul?</hi>
Not a ſyllable. But all upon ſuppoſition, that ſomewhat was
due before; Let that be paid; or if not, the allowed ancient
courſe is awakened and quickened for recovery. So 'tis onely
a Declaratory Law, as Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> ſpeaks often upon
like occaſion, renewing what was, and rowſing up the dulneſs
of perverſe and covetous men to pay, who were found back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
but this was a goad to force them on forward in the
way they had went, and wherein they ought to go. It were a
diſparagement to have here a Right ſettled to the Thing, and
to it in our opinion, (yea, to our opinion it ſelfe) to think
ſo.</p>
               <p>But it ſeemeth things went not on by help of this new Law
fully according to deſire: The Times were we know troubled,
and many other Rights being both unſettled and removed,
no marvell if theſe (Neighbours to them) were alſo ſhaken.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:58798:99"/>
Divers no doubt wiſhed them more then ſo, quite down, the
<hi>mouthes</hi> or rather <hi>Gulphs,</hi> or rather then both <hi>helliſh depths</hi>
of ſacrilegious and covetous carnal men having never been
but wide open to devour what ever was ſacred, and here ſtood
gaping to ſwallow this morſell none of their Own, but due to
man in Juſtice, as well as to God for Religion, and by Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
For going on to ſubtract the juſt payment, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
is evident, inſhrined in the ſacred Monuments of the
Law it ſelfe, and entered the Parliament Roll for memory,
with what the wiſedom of that Councel (the Repreſentative
of the Nation) could afford for remedy of ſo large a ſpreading
inconvenience. It was intended chiefly for the new Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priator
inabling him being Lay to make his Complaint in the
ſpiritual Court, but reaching in all other alſo; with intent to
let him in with them, by no means purpoſing to ſhut or let
both out, and though with due reſtraint at firſt to that <hi>examen</hi>
onely, yet Evaſions were after found that both have uſed to
go out, where no more was intended but to let one in. The
Law ſpeaks as followeth.</p>

be reached here, which every private man ſhould do well to

from that moſt Learned man,
(which ſeems alſo his conſtant reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
becauſe he repeats it,) and it is,
That the proper ſcene of the trial of

Conſiſtory,<note place="margin">Cook in Inſtit. 2. pa. 661. <hi>on this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Statute of</hi> 2 Edw. 6. <hi>And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, on the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of</hi> Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectè agatis. pa. 489. <hi>and in</hi> Inſtit. 4. chap 53. pa 260.</note> till placed there by <hi>Circumspectè agatis, Articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li
Cleri, 18 Edw. 3. chap. 7. &amp;c.</hi> but in the County Court;
Which if, much of what before would loſe much of its
ſtrength, But ſeems not ſo allowable for theſe following rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</p>
               <p>I. No ſuch thing is averred plainly and poſitively, in any
of theſe Laws, or any other, And that had need be plain and
poſitive ſhould have changed a thing, Such a thing in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>II. The evident contrary is in them all either expreſſed
or inſinuated. For, for the latter it mentions the remanding
or diſmiſſing ſuits of Diſmes back from the Secular Judge,
which muſt be ſure ſomewhither: And for the two former
which might be anſwered to create that referrer, take them
either together, or apart:</p>
               <p>1. Together, and ſo they mention ſeverally a Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<hi>Prohibiting, what ſay I?</hi> That which never
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:58798:104"/>
was? Or, then was no where? This were non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe
as to the reaſon of it, and it were a great ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
to the wiſdome and gravity that hath always
attended thoſe Aſſemblies to ſuppoſe they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
any thing for Law that might imply contrariety
or abſurdity in truth and reaſon: As that, That
ſhould be prohibited to be, that had not been, or
that the Kings Judges ſhould deal circumſpectly with
the Eccleſtaſtical, not forbidding them to hold plea of
that they never did hold plea. The rule is in nature
before the exception, the thing before the limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
And exhibition of ſomething granted and uſed
before there can be thereof a Prohibition; As there
muſt be Marriage before Divorce, and a property of
<hi>Meum &amp; Tuum,</hi> before the Decalogue can take place
forbidding to ſteal: Even ſo here, there muſt have
been a trial of tythes before with the Eccleſ. Judge,
before the Kings could be prohibited to prohibit him;
his hands muſt have been looſe, before they could be
forbid to be bound, and He uſed no meddle before
any could ſoberly and rationally meddle to hinder
his medling.</p>
               <p>2. Apart, and ſo all is yet plainer: for conſider them
diſtinctly, and by the firſt Chapter of <hi>Articuli Cleri,</hi>
No prohibition was to take place to hinder the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Court in matter of tythes, and ſurely then the
buſineſs was there: And for <hi>Circumspectè agatis</hi>
there is expreſs mention of their there trial. For the
Judge of <hi>Norwich</hi> was not to be hindred, nor his
Clergy, if, 1. they held plea of things meerly ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
as of penance, &amp;c. in their Court Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>2. Nor if a Parſon demanded of his Pariſhioners ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
or tythes due and accuſtomed, &amp;c. (So that,
They were there Then demanded:) and in the cloſe:
<hi>In all caſes afore rehearſed the Spiritual Judge
ſhall have power to take knowledge</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Kings Prohibition. Which is not a little
ſtrengthned by a former Statute, (as it ſeems it is,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:58798:105"/>
though of the ſame year, for it is placed before it,)
where<note n="1" place="margin">Weſtm. 2. c. 5. 13 Edw. 1. in Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons <hi>Abridg.</hi> p 50</note> it is ſaid: When once in a Writ of <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavit</hi>
the buſineſs is deraigned in the Kings Court
(that the prohibiting Patron can ſuſtain no conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
loſs in any part of his Lay Advowſon,) preſently
as it comes to be a caſe of tythes it is ſent back to the
Court Chriſtian, and<note n="2" place="margin">The ſame Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes (of <hi>Articuli Cleri, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectè Agatis, &amp; Weſtm.</hi> 2.) allow to the Spirituall Iuriſdiction cognizance of a fifth, and of all parts leſſe then a fourth of the value of the Church in tythes controverted between two Parſons. And no <hi>Iudicavit</hi> is grantable to forbid the ſuit of one of them commenced for any leſſe part in respect of the Patrons Right onely. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon them by conſequence hath any Writ of Right of any part of Tythes that appears not to be a fourth part of the Churches value been allowable. So expoundeth M. <hi>Selden</hi> in his Hiſtory of Tythes, <hi>pa</hi> 427.</note> 
                  <hi>the plea ſhal paſſe there ſo
far forth as it is deraigned in the Kings Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. The Stat. of 1 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. 13. mentions it then, as <hi>Of
old,</hi> and had <hi>Wont to be,</hi> that tythes ſhould be tryed where
they were ſent, but had been lately reſtrained; which had
been very inconveniently ſaid of ſuch late times as were ſo
little before as almoſt within an hundred years, eſpecially by
a grave Parliament, as was urged before, which uſeth to
meaſure words and know things. But of this ſufficiently
there.</p>
               <p>IV. The Statute of Conſultation, alledged alſo before,
was made 24 <hi>Edw. 1. ſc.</hi> before two of the three alledged, and
ſo ſpeaks as could not be ſuppoſed more plain againſt ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the Eccleſiaſtical Judges by Prohibition: which ſhews
ſurely they did proceed then.</p>
               <p>V. Review and call to mind what was ſaid before here,
<note n="3" place="margin">Pa 103, 104. &amp;c.</note> both of erecting the Eccleſiaſtical Court, and trial of
tythes there, and how long, (for they were under the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non)
and this will be much toward, or reach home to the
clearing of the whole buſineſs.</p>
               <p>VI. Examine things according to their nature, and they
would ſeem always fitlieſt here conſiderable: For who looks
upon things as they are, and thinks not every man fitteſt to
take care of his own matters? The Church fitteſt to look to
the things and ſupport of the Church? Or, that the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of our Religion could have been ever anywhere more
fitly inquirable and determinable of, then in the Court Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:58798:105"/>
the Court of Religion? Yea, even frther for this
reaſon, becauſe they were <hi>spiritualibus annexa,</hi> as <hi>Bracton</hi>
calls them ordinarily, they muſt be in way of tryal <hi>ſpirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tati
annexa.</hi> And hence alſo we finde the purpoſed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed
tractation of them, as in their proper Cell, in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons;
Not in the Statutes, nor in the Year-books, nor in
<hi>Bracton,</hi> nor <hi>Fleta,</hi> nor the Common Law it ſelf, (of late
days,) for the nature of them brought them elſewhere for
Regulation and Tractation; Why not? Yea, neceſſarily
Therefore to the anſwering Court for diſcuſſion.</p>
               <p>VII. Take the opinion of one, not leſs Learned (without
diſparagement,) then that Learned Juſticer, who with judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and much freedome inquired here into, and purpoſely
long ſince; And he ſettles the Juriſdiction from the County
to the Conſiſtory by the Conquerour, as before.<note n="1" place="margin">

and with equal diligence is troubled to find, as a rarity, ſome
other in the Kings Court ſo low, as about <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. and King
<hi>John,</hi> and then Regularly they began to come to the Church
alone, and nere there handled at firſt inſtance onely. This,
(and it hath been ſo ever ſince) is long before 9 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>VIII. The Stat. <hi>De Regia Prohibitione,</hi> ſeems made

and are ſaid to ſhift faces and change ſhapes; now for This,

as ſold returning back again to <hi>Weſtminſter. Quo teneam
nodo?</hi> yet thus it is, and the thing the ſame under ſeverall
ſuppoſitions and conſiderations. Many other ſuch aſſertions,
ſuppoſitions, and intimations there are in him; The whole
frame of whoſe Diſcourſe bends this way, or is managed as
ſuppoſing things thus, and I am confident he hath not any
thing to the contrary. As for <hi>Glanvil</hi> who was before, he
mentions the Court Chriſtian often, but never tythes tryed
there that I could finde, (though <hi>Glebe</hi> often;) This I
confeſs: But then withall he mentions them not all to trial,
nor as here, nor anywhere elſe, and ſo his authority is to
be drawn neither way. <hi>Bracton</hi> dates from the fartheſt back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
beſides, And he hath as hath been ſeen.</p>
               <p>And theſe things do, I reſt aſſured, ſecure the thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
for the Juriſdiction of tythes ſooner in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory
(and by conſequent their right) then was allowed
by that moſt learned man. I hope his friends and favourers
will not take it amiſs that a Pigmy dare confront a Gyant, or
<hi>Hercules</hi> in his power have ſome oppoſition by a weak and
common paſſenger: <hi>Magis amica veritas,</hi> it muſt be ſo with
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:58798:107"/>
me, and before whomſoever the beauty of Truth moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and lovely. <hi>Exoſculor,</hi> I profeſs to love and reverence
the memory of that moſt deſerving man, both bleſſing and
admiring the footſteps of his ingenouous ſedulity, wherever
I ſee him tracing with ſo much care, induſtry, eloquence and
gravity, the windings and turnings of his ſacred profeſſion,
(for he was a Judge of <hi>Iſrael:</hi>) But <hi>magna eſt veritas &amp;
praevalebit,</hi> Truth hath the greateſt command, power,
and luſtre with me before All, and muſt ever prevailbefore any
opinions, perſwaſions, perſons or names of men in the world.
Which I take to be here, that the Juriſdiction of tythes was
not made a branch of Church-power by force or permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of any ancient Statute, but a native and connatural branch
of her firſt power, born with it and receiving life in this world,
and hath been bred, continued, conſerved, and brought up
with it hitherto, nor ſince that Court has been, but this hath
been a part of its work through all ages and generations.
And ſo ſhould I have done with this Statute, (whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
have occaſioned this digreſſion,) but that finding there
a clauſe for perſonal tythes, yet in force, and the things due,
but little ſaid of them elſewhere, and this thought the Onely
ground; For illuſtration of a dark truth, and clearing their
doubted right, I think it not amiſs to continue a few ſteps
more beſides the direct way, to enquire preſently what dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
radication they may be diſcovered to have then the bare
command of that ſingle authority: For no queſtion is, but
they are due, and in conſcience ought to be paid, as well as
other dues, the Law remaining, whoſe Dueneſs ariſes onely
by the word of the Law: <hi>Neceſſitate praecepti,</hi> as we ſay, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by vertue of the commandment; no other equity or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of the Thing appearing, but onely becauſe they are ſtated
ſettled Rights, by like reaſon where to here. He that denies
my Heriot or Relieve, may as well his half years rent: He that
ſhuffles for his ſuit or ſervice, Homage or Fealty, by like
reaſon (why not?) for his Corn or money: For the ſame
Law gives the ſame Due to all; They ſtand upon the ſame
bottome, are brought in by the ſame Spring, and if this prove
too weak for the one, it may not be long ere Thence the other
fall ſhort of Home alſo.</p>

material are to be obſerved to have been
laid down before in the boſom of the

both found and already given them before remembred and

ſeverall Chapters are taken up there about the diſpoſition of
them, the heads whereof were given before, and into the
Contents of one of them this very Statute is taken and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized;
If there had been a new Canon Law, thoſe Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ſhould have been part of it; As there is none, the old is
of force, and in all its power beſide the Statute, and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
by Statute. Neither had the thing onely conſideration in
Books; we finde regard given to it in the Acts of Men, and
the World buſied, not to ſay very much troubled about the
Wealth that came in by them. The great and vexed Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
in <hi>Oxford,</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> 6. time about <hi>Fr. Ruſſell</hi> and his
Doctrine which took up the learned Diſputes of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
there, and ſmoother Conſultations alſo of the Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at <hi>London,</hi> and after was tranſmitted to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there
not ended, was onely about the neceſſary and fit Receiver of
perſonal Tythes; while he maintained, it ſeems, to his own
advantage, and againſt the Secular Prieſts, that they might be
given as well to the poor as the Church, as we ſay, to the
Monk as to the Prieſt, (and then he ſtood ready as a Mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,
as the Prieſt for his Pariſh:) They on the contrary to
the Church onely, and ſo He and His were excluded. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
it ſeems ſettled (the <hi>major</hi> part) againſt him, and
he for his errour was injoyned to recant publickly at <hi>Pauls</hi>
Croſſe, leſſe then the performance whereof would not ſerve
the turn, and all the Pulpits in <hi>England</hi> commanded to ring of
what an Hereſie <hi>Fr. W. Ruſſell</hi> had maintained (indeed againſt
the Pulpits) about perſonal Tythes, now to be cried down by
all opportunity, and the utmoſt of poſſibility. The Particulars
I finde<note n="1" place="margin">By Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> in his Hiſtory of Tythes, <hi>cap. 7. Sect</hi> 5.</note> related at large; the uſe I make of them is onely
this, that Theſe things Have been of Real conſideration, not
an empty Book Order, but ſuch as had influence upon things
and produced viſible effect, the Conſultations of Men having
been taken up about the diſpoſall of the ſeen fruit of them,
much buſying, yea not a little troubling the World, for long
ſince, and ſo long together, and ſo no doubt things ſtood to
<hi>Edward</hi> 6. time, and ſo he found and left them. Whereupon,
and that ancient rooted Right (ſpreading likely further, as
might be found by further inquiry, if it were alſo need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,)
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:58798:110"/>
he ſettled his new vote and order of confirmation as it
were: What, to make perſonal tythes due! to give them
life and raiſe them to being! Nothing leſs: to revive and
quicken the Law, that dull men that were to pay, and had
wont, might be rouzed up to a ready and obedient perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of that which was their ancient known duty, to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
juſtice, and force backward men to bring in their publick
tribute, which though for Gods ſervice their worldlineſs had
rather perhaps were left out or let alone: Due they were
before; This vote of publick power onely cleared the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
that the in-come might be it ſelf, and come in freſh and
free, without impediment, for which His words and Act
reach, we ſee, fully his meaning.</p>
               <p>By occaſion of which clauſe of ſuch import, thus much:
Thus much of Perſonal Tythes, And thus much alſo for that
laſt binding Act of State both for perſonal and predial, in 2
<hi>&amp; 3 Edw.</hi> 6. Behither which is little but the implying Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Right, (in the grant of All mens, without doubt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Theſe,) That other was the laſt, clear, full, expreſſe,
purpoſed and direct binding order. Not yet of no force;
Even for it ſelf; though the chief ſtrength (beſide the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative
power of the Land, here drawn into Act) is in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
and before; The Root that ſupports and cheriſhes moſt
powerfully (both predial and perſonal ſtill,) laying farther
in the Right created by ancient Conſtitutions, deeper then
poſſibly can be thought by any new declaration. For we ſhall
ſeldome meet with a tree that planted the laſt year hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
much ſtrength; It muſt have time to root and ſettle,
before it can be able to endure the ſhock of a tempeſt, or
make good its being againſt any forceable oppoſition: So
the beſt and uſefulleſt Conſtitutions of State are thoſe expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
firm ones, that have lived, ſummered and wintered
with us, as we ſay, and given approbation of their agreeing
with the ſoil by having ſafely endured there all influences;
Settling and gathering ſtrength, (as it uſes to be, and Muſt)
by degrees, and in and with time claſping in faſt to be made

days when the Aged decree Judgement, the ancient and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced

ſounding all along, and conceſſion of Them, and in anſwer
to ſuch a Petition, the particulars are within the poſſible and
eaſie view of every Engliſh mans eye, and they fitly All march
under the Head of the Petition of Right. Now then I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
and argue: What is that was here granted? Was it not
Right? Right to All? and one mans Right as well as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
Did not the whole Commonalty petition? Were not
All heard? Was not All granted, and to All? And if thoſe
that wait upon the Temple of the Lord in <hi>England</hi> in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Service, had thereby then, and yet have, they and their
ſucceſſours an Own and Right, was not this then meant to
be granted? and was granted and ſettled upon them There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thereby, nor can be revoked, but by the revocation of
this, or a part of this Conceſſion of Right? Each mans wrong
is of the ſame nature, guilt, injury, crime, and grievance,
Nor can they ever be interpreted but partiall and unjuſt ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of ſuch a claim to themſelves, as, Any others having e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
part with them therein, they can be contented earneſtly
to ſtrive for their own, and will not be denyed, but for thoſe
others, think they may be excluded, (or help to exclude them)
at pleaſure, and no matter whether they partake of any ſhare
in the common allowed ſtock of Right. As if it were Theft
to ſteal, but not from ſome: Injury to defraud, but the Red
or Gray Coat, not the Black: The Law muſt hold in ſome
caſes, what need it in other? to retain him in poſſeſſion of
his Right that hath nine parts, but not him that hath right
to the Tenth; One mans Own may not be taken away, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly

though it were ſeen to be made of the ſame breadth, ſtrength

One word alſo in the ſpirit of meekneſs, to him not hitherto
thought of, that is, I take it eaſie enough to be led, but as it
falls out miſerably out of the way, that follows the light of
his eyes, and they guide him to errour, urging the Petition
of Right for every ones and his own, and yet crying down
tythes thereby, which being a Right can certainly have no
diſcountenance, but muſt rather have a firm, conſequentiall
eſtabliſhment by that Petition. <hi>Philip, Philip,</hi> underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
thou what thou readeſt? Do but ſay, I pray thee, what
is it thou ſo importunately calleſt for? Is it not for Right?
Civil Right? Every ones? Thy Neighbours as well as thine
own? And Chriſts Miniſters, if he have Right, yea, Civill
Right, hereby to his Tenth, as well as thou to thy Nine?
If this; why perverteſt thou the right words of the Law, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
again preſently what but now thou buildedſt up, and
by or with thy hoarſe and importunate out-cries for this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,
endeavoureſt to cry down tythes thereby, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Right (ſure Mans right is not Gods right) cannot but
have thereby a clear and evident confirmation. Is not ones
mans right of the ſame kinde with anothers? and as good
as anothers? Muſt not thy Paſtors have been included in
All? Or, couldeſt thou be content to have his little portion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
at leaſt to be ſtruck out of this book of temporal life
to augment thy part, to a proportion of ninefold bigger then
His already? What equity were this, or ſhew of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?
Suffer I pray thee the word of exhortation, and be not
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:58798:113"/>
offended if I tell thee the truth: If thou be a Chriſtian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
thou wilt not entertain a gentle reproof with diſdain, nor
repay meekneſs with rage, ſtorming at him that would by the
grace of God, and according to the light given him, deliver out
nothing to thee but the words of truth and ſoberneſs. Ask
thy Lawyer, and he will tell thee: Adviſe with the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in his own profeſſion: Conſult with the Potter about
the things of his own trade. There is never a Judge at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
never a Serjeant in their Innes, never a learned
Councellour or knowing man in this Land, but will aſſure
that tythes are as due (beſides the rules of equity, <hi>for
work,</hi> and generals of Scripture, <hi>for competent maintenance</hi>)
by the Law, the rule of Civil righteouſneſs among us, to
their due receivers here, as any rent, or rent-charge, debt
or bond, (not a benevolence, but a ſtrict Right,) and that
the ſettled and compleat body of the Law doth with as
much unanimity, evidence, conſtancy, and aged conſent agree
to ſettle and ſay ſo for them; and yet doeſt thou contend,
and urge a publick grant of right as an argument to deſtroy
them? Thoſe ſages are wiſe; They will not deny their books;
They cannot deny this; Thou muſt conſent to it; Thou haſt
nothing to ſay againſt it; Where art thou now? On <hi>Gods</hi>

as in one verſe of one Chapter of the whole Bible; Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
therefore to every man his due, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 7? Keep to this,
I deſire no more: I know I have gained with thy honeſty, thy
ſure vote for tythes, and for ever hereafter; Hold to this
Conceſſion, and be conſtant, thou wilt never hold up an angry
hand nor finger againſt them, or but for them, unleſs thou
change thy minde to petition againſt the petition. Thou
wilt not I ſuppoſe be wiſer then the Law, mangle the Royall
Grant, or deform that Petition of Parliament: If thou do,
1. Thou art unjuſt, becauſe not impartial: 2. Inconſtant,
becauſe even now thou choſeſt to ſubmit Hereto, and madeſt
uſe of it: 3. In plain terms little better then a fool! Bear
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:58798:114"/>
with my plainneſs, thou wilt rather thank me for it, when
thou ſhalt ſee I intend not Reviling, or Reproach, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
home caution and admonition. Reſolve with thy ſelf,
There is none ſo highly ſuch, and dangerouſly too, as he that
thinks himſelf wiſer then the Law: Which is, as a Lord Chief
Juſtice ſaid, <hi>Summa Ratio,</hi> the ſtrength and Quinteſſence of
Humane reaſon applied to the common good; and what muſt
He needs be then that goes on the contrary part? that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalues
it? that oppoſes it? that cenſures it? and in ſtead
of obeying the Oracle, quarrels with it? Laws are made to
be reverenced, not diſputed of, obeyed, not judged, ſubmitted
to, not cenſured by every forward man, ſcarce by every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of men, ſcarce by knowing, wiſe men: and who
is he then that of his own private head dares buſily controul
and cenſure? abrogate and revoke, repeal and eſtabliſh
the whole or a part, (as much as ſeems good unto him,
be it what it will) of a Wiſe Parliaments Petition, a dead
Kings Conceſſion, the Statute Law, the Canon Law, the
Common Law, that whole body that hath ruled all actions
and poſſeſſions here? Thinking, ſuch a part may be changed,
another ſpared; The great Charter was well thought on in
ſome things; The Petition of Right was part as it ſhould;
K. <hi>Edwards</hi> old aged and reverenced Laws, that had ſo many
requeſts made for them, ſo many bloudy battails fought about
them, and were wreſted by the people into the Coronation
Oath, may now be adviſed of: I ſee a way, not ſpyed by
any ſince Chriſtianity came hither (and yet they had the voice
of the Spirit, in the Word of the Goſpel) of Civil Juſtice
and Righteouſneſs, I will make Laws, change Ordinances, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
Rights, new-mould properties and dominions, &amp;c.
though all that is be troubled, &amp;c. and the Petition for every
mans right ſhall not hinder: What arrogance is this? What
intolerable preſumption? Does it become a private man! a
ſingle man! a ſimple man! Any man! Were not obedience
better then this ſacrifice? To be ruled by the Law, better
then thus to quarrell about it? Say but this one thing,
Every man ſhall have his own: and I have obtained my
end, and wiſh all unſaid hath (to thy offence or otherwiſe,)
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:58798:114"/>
not tended hereto. Say but Right ſhall be done as is deſired,
(<hi>Soit droit fait come eſt deſire,</hi> as the King:) I will not be
wiſer then the Law but follow it: I will not judge the Rule,
but be ruled by it; 'tis the bleſſed Ordinance of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
I ought conform, and muſt, and will, ingenuouſly, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the whole and every part, and then we are met and friends.
Eſpecially the Petition of Right, let no one be defrauded of
his part of that, No One, and then be the iſſue that God will

                  <hi>there is

Teſtament: for the People of the new Law be bound to
greater things then the People of the old Law were, as it
appeareth, <hi>Matth. 5 20. And the ſacrifice of the old Law is
not ſo honourable as the ſacrifice of the new Law is; for
the ſacrifice of the old Law was onely the figure, and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of the new Law is the thing that was figured; That
was the ſhadow, this is the truth. And therefore the Church
upon that reaſonable conſideration ordained that the tenth
part ſhould be paid for the ſuſtenance of the Miniſters in the

upon the matter a granting of all: the ſending for Triall to
where before it is known what will be there ſaid, a virtual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
and confirmation of what ſhall be there done; As
he that refers to the Admiral Court does, upon the matter like
and approve the Civil Law ſo far forth there ruling. And our
ſtate having many Rules <hi>de pactis,</hi> but few <hi>de legatis,</hi> or of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:58798:117"/>
Wills themſelves, ſending, in its Own want, to Another place,
and willing the Rules of the Canoniſt or Civilian ſhall take
place, does interpretatively ſpeak further, That what is there
done and decreed is juſt, and by it ſelf approved; Even ſo the
party grieved appealing to the Temporal Court, making his
Caſe known there, Praying relief which is denied, His tenth
fliece or ſheaf are like to be taken away, and upon Complaint,
nor Parliament, nor Common Law afford him any comfort,
but their Miniſters or Conſultations and Reſolutions ſend him
back to where the taking away ſhall be allowed; What is this
but mediately, remotely, and implicitly, but fully to approve
of what is there done? For they are preſumed willing to do
juſtice, and known able, but not interpoſing, do conſent and
partake in the deciſion they order to, be it where and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
So that it is no vain ſuggeſtion ſo often repeated, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to be always underſtood, that the making good the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
is the ſecuring all, for all comes along with it, as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homets
Alcoran</hi> will bring a long Tenths with it to Religion
and for Conſcience in way to his Paradiſe, (but no Wine upon
earth) and as the entertaining the Jews Law includes Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,
Paſsover, Pentecoſt, the Sabbath too, and even Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.
And ſo have been the proceedings with us, That Court,
and thoſe diſcuſſions have uſed to bring in Tythes effectually,
and not but ever; Ask either the Lawyers or Owners, they
who did judge or were judged, They both found the tranſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of Wealth and Riches to be accordingly: Prohibitions if
they were often granted, were ſeldom asked, and always deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but if according to theſe Rlues: The Judge was <hi>Lex lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quens,</hi>
the ſpeaking Oracle, and nor did, nor would oppoſe, or
ſpeak or do otherwiſe: &amp; to their coſt always men found it to
be moſt true. In the Manuſcript before mentioned, with <hi>Magna

ſtill, no pretence was to impede the Juriſdiction of known due
Tythes; but if the Court were extravagant, and would med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with what was Lay, then clog it with a prohibition that it
might not exceed its bounds; otherwiſe let it go on and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
freely and fully without any manner of diſturbance. And
this I ſay, hath been the known way of proceeding; view their
Books, ask the Lawyers themſelves, they will allow (though
they may finde ſome fault in my expreſſion) the reality of
things, and that what I aim at is right, though I may faulter
in the way of expreſſion: Nor is any thing more certain then
the Reſtraint of their Reſtraints, the Prohibiting of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions,
that they ſhould not ſtep forth to hinder the Court
Spiritual in that was ſuch, or belonged thereto, the certain
Conſequent whereof was a known Recovery, and tranſlation

forecaſt, and conditioned not to be tyed too ſtrictly
to Rules of Method though of mine own making: Too much
exactneſs may be as incommodious, as altogether looſe: This
belongs to what I was upon, the Juriſdiction of Tythes, and
thereby right: and to the reflections of the Temporal State,
as it ſtood ſeparate, and favouring glances (of which ſort onely

Statutes, could ſo many effectual, and in other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
ſufficiently made Rules of Right be here made, and yet
not made, and yet have born rule with obeyed power? If
Civill Right be ſtood upon, could All ſo Many operative
and continuing cauſes thereof have wrought from time to
time kindly and vigorouſly without any effect, or but <hi>Muſt</hi>
contribute and do what humane Pactions and Conceſſions
could, or any thing below the footſtool of Gods Throne?
The <hi>Divine Right</hi> I confeſs is of another ſort, more awful,
it ſeparates clearly to <hi>an higher kinde,</hi> and we look upon
it as (more venerable,) <hi>founded in God,</hi> and partaking

without ſhadow of change <hi>the Same,</hi> Nor can be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
upon rudely with profane hands without a <hi>Relative
violation</hi> of that Majeſty above from whence it proceeds:
(And Therefore men ſhould be very wary how they affixe
this ſeal <hi>of Heaven</hi> to every <hi>Imagination of their Own,</hi>
ſtamping the Character of Divine Right upon diſputable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
entituling God thereby to their perſwaſions, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
errours of fancies, and but what they ſtrongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

Higheſt preſumption!) But ſpeak of <hi>Humane Right,</hi>

what has its firmneſs whence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all lower titles and incloſures
have, the <hi>agreeing Acts of Men,</hi> and <hi>Mutual Humane
Stipulation;</hi> Of this ſort I believe we ſhall ſeldome finde
any thing better grounded or faſter ſettled then This, (And
if ſeconding and conſpiring rules of common equity can
contribute any thing to the backing and ſtrengthening of
what is ſo placed and ſettled, theſe not wanting neither)
and by as good title as any men have any thing with us,
our tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> has here in <hi>England</hi> the ſame to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Equail in this too, that 'tis <hi>as good as
the best,</hi> and if we had any better or higher, this would
no doubt come out with <hi>the higheſt:</hi> But we have none;
Our Tribes pretend not to a partition from Heaven; nor
Dominion, or Property, Lordſhips, Mannours, or Honours
to any thong to be cut out by but inferiour, lower, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
rules of <hi>arbitrary good Will and Pleaſure,</hi> guided <hi>by
compact and Humane Wiſdome;</hi> And therefore <hi>Levi</hi> hath
no reaſon to take it amiſs if in this he be not preferred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
his Brethren to a right of another ſort (if it ſhould
prove ſo) and higher ſtrain having a touch of ſacred and
extraordinary, ſealed from Heaven; But rather bleſs his
God if he have done full out ſo much for him, as for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
(and as he did anciently heretofore among his own
people,) giving him an <hi>Equall Higheſt Claim and Right
with the Beſt,</hi> and as <hi>near Divine</hi> as any of his Nation.
Which is both done and cleared certainly, and ſhould ſerve
his turn ſufficiently and abundantly.</p>

               <p>2. And for the unreaſonableneſs here, it is without cauſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.
For it may be conſidered, and muſt be granted, 1. That
the Stage is open, what is or is done in the World cannot but
be known. 2. Men love their own. 3. Are apt to make out for it.
4. Have means to come by it. 5. In the honeſteſt, ſureſt, and
beſt ways that could yet be found of Law. 6. Whether in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
or Action what is not found amiſs, is reaſonably to be
judged well. Now theſe things preſumed and known, and
withall it being ſeen, ſuch a one Has; how unlikely is it but
that he ſhould and ought to Have, elſe we ſhould not ſee him
Have? or if the right were in another, the Poſſeſſion, which
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:58798:126"/>
he cannot but love, muſt bee with him? If there were no
Courts, or preſumed Partiall, or men negligent, or the
whole frame of things compoſed toward injuſtice, to make or
let things alone ill, or not well, Then might we doubt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably,
and againſt the Poſſeſſour cheriſh vehement ſuſpition:
but nothing being more evident then the above mentioned &amp;
to be granted aſſurances leading directly to the contrary,
How can we but judge for what Is? and that the Law is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
favouring the Poſſeſſour as it does; (<hi>Praeſumptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus
ſtandum est donec probetur in contrarium,</hi> as before:)
and that he hath right, for if he had not, as things are, hee
ſhould not have? I will not deny but ſome hard meaſure
may be hereby meted out to ſometimes, or perhaps wrong,
But this in ſome degree may well be allowed the Soveraigne
Authour of All our right: Better this then worſe, (as worſe
would be if this were not,) and ſith of two this way is the

<hi>Much, Every way.</hi> Be it firſt reſumed, that They

by evidence certain and notorious. This then laid in to the

Shall they have no favour by that All have favour, no benefit

them no ways? Shall men look upon ſecuring enriching Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,

<hi>How the Churches Perſon or Man, in the ſenſe before, can

reality, a poſſeſſion (or <hi>quaſi</hi> poſſeſſion) of theſe things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
fancy or ſpeculation: Not of the things indeed ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

that is poſſeſſed continually, even when the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
are not: As a Lord is poſſeſſed of a Quit-rent ſeven
years together, and yet he receives it but once a yeare, his
right is inherent when the power is not uſed: Or, as a man
poſſeſſes a way over ſuch a ground, not by the Land it ſelf, but
by the leave, he may when he will, and will when he liſts, and
that liſt comes as often as there is occaſion, Thus to make
uſe of the Land for his Service. For underſtanding which
things the better, we muſt have recourſe to a known diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
even in Law, or a ſeparation or ſorting out poſſeſſions
into two kindes, of Rights, and Things; Corporeal, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeall.
The one (Corporeal) are poſſeſſed but by gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſping,
or claſping the Things, as in our hands, &amp;c. The other
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:58798:128"/>
Incorporeall (the Rights) are enjoyed, even in the uſe, or
having uſed, and ſo continually enjoyed, even when the uſe
it ſelf (the fruit) is not. As the Patron of an Advowſon in
groſs, 1. Has never the Glebe, nor Church, nor Tythes, nor
any thing ſeen: 2. Nor has (it may be) preſented theſe 20
years paſt, or for theſe 20 years to come may not, yet ſtill
all this while he hath ever a Right to preſent, (if<note n="1" place="margin">Vid. Bract. lib. 2. cap. 23. ſect. 3, 4. &amp; Flet. l. 3. cap. 15. ſect. 16.</note> ever
he preſented, or had right, which right is <hi>lieger dormant</hi>
with him continually, till he draw his power into act, as he
does when is occaſion, reaping ſome fruit of that right which
was though ſeldome uſed, inherent continually: Even ſo
the occaſionall Receiver of Tythes, it may be once a year, or
whenſoever, has ſtill <hi>Jus ad rem,</hi> that is, to the taking them
up when they ſhall be, which is the fruit, Though not <hi>Jus in

he reaps the fruit of this power onely in the fruits of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt.
Much is ſaid of theſe things both among our Lawyers

it was ſpread abroad, and yet remains at the ſea coaſts, that

triable, and the doubts of them onely diſputable and
determinable in that Court, by rule and practiſe, where few
of earthly or meer worldly things were once thought of, and
whoſe natural and firſt proper eſſential bound of Juriſdiction
was, <hi>Spiritualia &amp; Spiritualibus annexa. There</hi> were
inquired into things above this world, and which could not
be regulated by common rules of Civil Juſtice, as Articles of
Religion, Exerciſe of Diſcipline, Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures, and
generally things being or reputed Sacred: And <hi>Thither Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,</hi>
as being of kinde and kin, did <hi>Theſe things</hi> throng in, or
rather were both admitted and invited, as Saying by Doing
what was, and that they were not reputed meerly of humane
conſideration, becauſe they were let in and there had regard
and only proper tractation or trial where things Divine and
moſt nearly belonging to God had or ſhould have had their
due inquiries. If the aim had been only to get in dues, (theſe
Dues,) to determine of Civil property, or to keep one man
alive in a Pariſh, All Civil Courts of Juſtice were open where
All ſuch things had their proper inquiries and reſolutions, and
the Tenth part needed not to have been ſeparate from the
Nine: But it ſeems ſomewhat farther was aimed at, and
meant or implyed which was the cauſe why theſe things were
parted, and the face of things ſeems to repreſent that there
was an apprehenſion and ſuppoſition that it was, becauſe they
were thought to draw near the things of God, and were, as
far as any, toward <hi>Beyond this world,</hi> and Therefore they were
ſorted with a ſcene accordingly, and had their trail and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion

               <p>Farther, by onely which kinde of Suppoſition the crime
can be aggravated of taking them away to that heighth it
commonly is, and men for purloining be accounted in the
number of more then unjuſt, <hi>Impious</hi> and <hi>Sacrilegious.</hi> For
it ſeems at leaſt unto me that it is not ſo much the violation
of any Command or Law humane or Divine, from earth or
above heaven if it were poſſible, can denominate and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
this ſin, (if that Law were as plain as another Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery, Thou ſhalt not
Steal;</hi>) But ſomething elſe and growing in the Nature of
the ſinne below that muſt advance the crime ſo high as to
change kinde and become of Wrong and Injuſtice, Impiety
and Sacriledge: To rob Heaven muſt offer violation to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and that be more then to offend in tranſgreſſing a Law
of Heaven. For the Morall Commandements above come
thence and are in force for us, and yet No one ſays Adultery
or Theft are Sacriledges: Sins they are, but that their full
latitude, the Divine Precept does not new ſpecifie the nature
of the offence, Theſe or Any. So heretofore, when <hi>Jus
divinum</hi> undoubted had bounded every ones own, The tribes
at leaſt if not the families were parted by ſure and immediate
Commiſſion from Heaven, yet the unjuſt invaſion of any part
even then was not counted, I believe, more then Unjuſt,<note n="1" place="margin">Qui rapit pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniam proximi ſui, iniquitatem operatur: qui au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem pecuniam, vel Res Eccleſiae abſtulerit, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legium facit.

and perhaps convert ſome ſmall contemptible portion thereof
to charitable uſe, the whole duty which herein we owe unto
God is fully ſatisfied. But foraſmuch as we cannot rightly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

               <p>Thus far that grave and judicious man; a piece from
whoſe page does more then a little adorn Ours: And ſo now
we have ſeen how Tythes have been intended to be ſettled on

been tryed accordingly, and this alone renders their ſpoliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

<hi>Sure then the world has looked upon them as Such: Sure they
have been reputed at leaſt as God's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It remains for application, How faſt and ſafe they ſhould
then be from injury and ſpoil, How inviolably not to bee
ſubtracted or touched, as things laid up in Heaven, as what
may not be purloined from the foot-ſtool of Gods Throne, (if
there they have been depoſited;) And Who is he dares put
his hand toward that God has touched before, or lay a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

wiſdome by the beſt contrivance of all its devices had
made and ſettled before for immoveable; and this we find not
in ſome ſcattered looſe ſheets, but the univerſall, all-ruling,
all-giving Law making faith for it; after the ſtabliſhing by Civil
ſanction, This coming in and ſaying, <hi>Theſe things were given

to this purpoſe, and More, let Mee have ſaid Nothing.
He more then pretends to ſift things to the utmoſt, and with
Curious Diligence and watchfull induſtry to dig down to the
root of the ancient conſtitution of things, and ſo give the
face of them as they have been from the beginning without
any <hi>fucus</hi> or deceitfull gloſs; and though he rove and fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate

From his eight Chapter of Laws, little can be had, but <hi>de
Jure,</hi> of the right, which has not alwayes taken place in
action; (for good Laws have not alwayes had the good hap
to conveigh ſo much felicity to the world as they might, by
being throughly and fully Obeyed:) but in the following he
comes home. Chap. 10. He<note n="2" place="margin">Pag. 278.</note> acknowledges ſome payment
under the Saxons by <hi>K. Knouts letter yet extant,</hi> or if not,
puniſhment: Many Churches under the Conqueror are<note n="3" place="margin">Pag. 280.</note>
marked with, <hi>Ibi decimae,</hi> in that moſt authentique memoriall
of our Nation, or perhaps this part of the world, the book of
<hi>Domus-Dei,</hi> as <hi>in Suſſex, Hampſhire, about Baſingstoke, &amp;c.</hi>
though this neither generall, nor common then. Other<note n="4" place="margin">Pag. 282.</note>
evidences of dueneſs and payment are <hi>under Hen.</hi> 1 &amp; <hi>Hen. 2.
and to them,</hi> And now they <hi>began to ſettle:</hi> A parochial Right is

of <hi>Hen.</hi> 2.) and it were ſomewhat hard to disbelieve in
matter of fact, ſuch and ſo ſolemn aſſeverations and depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But about <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. a parochiall right is granted by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
evident <hi>from the Stat. of Circumſpecte agatis, and the

                  <note n="6" place="margin">Pag. 285.</note> And <hi>by the practiſe of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
it became clear law (as it remains alſo at this day,</hi> he ſays)
<hi>that Regularly, if no other title or diſcharge, to be specially

every Parſon had a common right to the Tythes of all
annuall increaſe (prediall and mixt) accruing within the limits
of his pariſh, without ſhewing other title to them in his Libell.</hi>
After, giving other things, as of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> from <hi>Chaucer,</hi> &amp;c.
He<note n="1" place="margin">Pag 288.</note> concludes plainly <hi>the received and acknowledged Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochiall

or a <hi>Modus decimandi,</hi> (which being Diſcharges,
doe clearly preſuppoſe and imply one ration:) And this (being
a Lawyer, he ſays) is <hi>Regularly clear Law.</hi> Some curioſities
there follow, and judicious, uſefull, needfull diſquiſitions,
but ſo as nothing impeaches a full and univerſall Parochiall
Right ſetled nine half hundred years agoe, even by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion:
And he hath been generally taken to be no great

him injurious or undeſerving: With his grant taken to be

he has enough to the ſame purpoſe, the minde whereof having

theſe things at home are agreeable to what was abroad, as

ſpeaks, Never making the right out of himſelf that it might

belonging to the Lord, is not ſo much a due iſſuable out of
that land he hath let to his Tenant, as a reſervation to himſelf
at firſt when the Land was let, and he parted with the fruit
of the ground; or as if the ſame Lord cuts his wood or
timber, and carries it away from his tenants land, His tenant
<hi>Pays it not,</hi> but <hi>gives way to the taking</hi> of that was always
excepted and reſerved; Or as no Mannour or Pariſh ever
laid out any Kings high-way, but the King alwayes kept it
for his other ſubjects out of the grant from himſelfe So, I
ſay, God reſerved (the times ſeemed to take things ſo,) the
tenth as his part never parted with, and as his Own (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

               <p>Now after this abundance together, it may be no doubt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous

of common obſervation could hardly eſcape their views,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:58798:146"/>
eſpecially His, who had examined that and more: What
might be had from hiſtory, pleas, writs, ſtatutes, and other
information of beſt but common credit, would be but to light
a candle before His Sun, or as the gleaning of a little after
full heaps, and therefore may well here be ſpared: In ſhort,
The clear evidence of Things abroad is ſuch, and the light of
Truth concerning them ſo common beating in every ones eys,
that no one that is fit to ſpeak, but muſt have knowledge
enough to ſay, that for Centuries upon Centuries, ages and
generations, and the repeated revolutions of many hundred
years, to create preſcription by continuance of paying and
receiving, There hath been time enough, and enough, and
enough and ſpare; and if twice five times ſufficient to raiſe it
in another caſe may here ſerve, (ſet aſide the otherwiſe ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

               <p>It is ſaid there could be none without poſſeſſion (whereon

<hi>though a voluntary conſecration might do the ſame;</hi> and
<note n="2" place="margin">Pa. 78.</note> afterwards, as this wars the cauſe of Right to a Church
whereto they had been ſo conveighed; ſo, <hi>Continuall Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of many years did ſo ſettle the perpetuall Right of the
Tythes of any Family then, that whither ſoever it transplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it ſelf, it muſt ſtill ſend whither it had uſed;</hi> as if this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
had for ever ſo bound it, that it might not pay them
otherwiſe. This then; and it was about ſeven or eight hundred
years ago; How much more ſtrength then muſt an uſage
that has its force and being from time, and ſo according to
nature, ſhould, (as it does) <hi>tractu temporis convaleſcere;</hi>
get vigour in its age, and be more fat and well liking? How
much more ſtrength, I ſay, muſt this uſe have <hi>Now,</hi> that how

if in ſome Countries there may be a preſcription, <hi>De non deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mando,</hi>

upheld, then whereby it may ceaſe? Shall Time be of force to

remembrance and due obſervation which was laid down
before, but had There ſo much amplification, becauſe it was
to have here its preſent uſe and operation, and it is, that <hi>This
Law</hi> is here below in this World, <hi>The onely <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mpire of all
things, the Rule of Right, the Judge of Own, the Stinter of
Strifes,</hi> and the only <hi>Didoes Thong</hi> that makes out the Line by

and among themſelves, the onely Donor and Continuer,
Preſerver, Suſtainer and Eſtabliſher of Every mans Due and
Own, by which he hath to himſelf What he hath, and No
one elſe hath any thing to do with His Right or Inheritance:
that gives the Maſter more then the Servant, the Gentleman
more then his Tenant, the Nobleman more than his Fermour,
or the rich and wealthy Merchant then his neighbour Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick;
intitles him to his Land (or Rent) fences in his Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,

and recover againſt the moſt ſtubborn and unconſcionable
injuſtice, Whereby he is ſo far as he is, Lord and Maſter of All
things. The Law, I ſay, The Law it ſelf doth this Alone, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioning
thus to every one certainly and juſtly, to every
fellow-Commoner His Own (in how much diſproportion of
Quantity ſoever, with the ſame Equality of Juſtice,) to one
man Delicates, to Another but bread; to One Silks, to Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

'Twere ſtrange to finde one of a Kinde ſingular
from all the reſt: He were a Monſter of his profeſſion that
had the protuberation of a ſtrange opinion <hi>exceſſive and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi>
out of his boſome, different from all other of his ſort:
And as ſuch they would look upon him at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> that
ſhould peep out into the world with this new diſcovery, that
<hi>Tythes are any longer Alms,</hi> or a <hi>Voluntary Benevolence for
the ſupport of Chriſtian truth, not Duty and a Due</hi> by ſtrict
retributive Juſtice. Have they not councelled? Have they
not practiſed? Have they not judged? Do they not Judge,
and ſtill commit ſentence to execution accordingly? And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
the whole ſeries of their moſt honourable ſtudies, and

men have not <hi>Given,</hi> but <hi>Paid:</hi> Could they ever relieve

Their <hi>Neighbour Bench had Ordered, Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

They, the Secular Courts themſelves have aſſiſted. For if the
Conſiſtory appointed, and the convicted denyed to pay, The
ſentence of Excommunication was Orderly and Leiſurely but
Certainly backed with the Writ <hi>De Excommunicato Capien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi>

Nay, themſelves have interpoſed (ſome ſay, Too far; the

my ſelf with a few: Beginning with that right worſhipfull

that ſhall heed the demonſtration he gives the world of his
Sufficiency in thoſe Noble Studies by his Gloſſary and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry

above even meaſure for a Profeſſour, and not unworthy to
teach ſome Maſters; As having digged down to the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Fundamentals, and not unworthy to ſit in the
higheſt Chair of the Learned. Now he tells us in one piece,
(as I remember, for I have not the Book by me,) that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
Tythes and other Rights of the Clergy had not been
primarily due unto God, by the (immediate) rule of his
Word, yet Are they Now His, and ſeparate from us by the
voluntary gift and dedication of our ancient Kings and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours:
and who ſhall violate the will of the dead! whoſe
impiety ſhall dare alter, change, invert, divert the ſtreams of
their pious bounty, and heavenly inſpired charity, out of

Secular, Temporal, All-ruling, All-giving, which ſettles all
men in their poſſeſſions and inheritances; and he alledges for
it divers of thoſe principles which before (as not borrowing

               <p>Thus far that learned and pious Knight: Which yet I
have not tranſcribed ſo fully as I meant, becauſe the words
of the Laws alledged by him, in the ſenſe we doe, and for
proof of the ſame concluſion, were repreſented in words at
length before upon occaſion; And yet thus much too was
needful to ſhew conſent, that we vent not, nor invent of our
own, but of the ſame words make conſtruction to the ſame
purpoſe, and have the ſame apprehenſion of things upon the
ſame grounds he both had and gave: Premiſes and Concluſion
the ſame from the ſame; for ſingularity either of opinion or
proof brings always with it ſome ſuſpition. We ſee, he ſaith &amp;
here proveth, that beſide Canonical, Natural, Moral, and as it
ſeems unto him, Divine Law, our Civil Laws have added what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
of ſtrength they can give to create a Topical and Engliſh
Political home-right of Dominion &amp; Power: <hi>Jure Soli</hi> as they
uſe to ſpeak, as well as <hi>Jure Poli,</hi> to ſettle theſe Dues where
they are. The former may have been our Anceſtory <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and Rules</hi> which guided them at firſt in ſettling as they
did, (and with theſe, many things elſe,) But now we little
need to go ſo far, (unleſs <hi>ex abundanti,</hi>) for Surpluſage of
ſtrength; for however it may have been diſputable at firſt

never a Pariſh in the Land, or Perſon of Cenſe and Poſſeſſion,

a ſet way as in the ſecular form of pleading upon Briefs, which
were always the ſame, like the laws of the Medes and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,

errour to have crept in, or been admitted or retained Here,
in that plea, which was a ventilation or exact diſcuſſion of the

and inviolable firm conſtancy and immutability was (no

upon truth anywhere, we may hope for it in thoſe lines
which have been ſo often handled and reviewed, and which
have themſelves handled and diſpoſed of ſo much of every

erroneous and deceitfull, So here, that they ſhould, being ſuch, have found
ſo ready and univerſall obedience, or that a wrongfull ſentence ſhould
have intruded to take place, eſpecially ſith to generall prejudice; Draining

ſtrength (as ſaid) we have not ſo much need to inquire for
a Divine Letter, becauſe we arrive at the ſame point ſafe and
ſure in the other way of Humane: for if Man have ſettled,
and God commanded to be paid, He have given, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
who is Gods Vicar, allow and injoyn payment;
Now even for Conſcience ſake that may not be omitted, And
whether the Scripture or Nature ſay any thing in the Caſe
particularly home, They ſay enough in eſtabliſhing humane
Ordinances, (which will bring God along with them,) and
Man for God muſt not but pay what Man has ſettled for
Gods Commandment ſake. So in this (new) way here is <hi>Jus Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinum,</hi>
or Divine Right ſtil Mediate and Conſequential, but ſure
and certain, which perhaps may not be in <hi>Virginia</hi> or <hi>New-England,</hi>
where the Goſpel may be yet in full vigour, or in

finde obedience; The Climate alters, and ſome particular
things done <hi>Here,</hi> which (I think,) <hi>There</hi> have not, and

they, (that is either thoſe remote ſtrangers, or our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
at home that Rely on Divine Right <hi>in ſcriptis</hi> or the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Letter of the Law,) ſhould loſe all with that Letter of
Scripture, and their proofs falling ſhort from Text or Reaſon,
they therewith fall ſhort of all proof, yet <hi>in this Our way</hi> we
keep enough in derivation of Conſequence, and by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
of a Civil Title granted and ſettled, we gain alſo
another of another ſort, Divine but Mediate, accumulate and
laſting, even when the immediate and literal is (in reality

               <p>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:58798:158"/>
In ſhort, we need not doubt of <hi>a Divine Right, Here, with

Yet ſpeak I not any of this laſt to evacuate or infirm that or
their opinion who go another way to ſtabliſh the opinion of

                  <hi>Except your righteouſneſs ſhall exceed</hi> (ſaith
He) (Yours, Ours, Anies, that is his Diſciple) <hi>the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall not enter into</hi>
my <hi>Kingdome of Heaven:</hi> Now what was Their Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs?
They paid dues Duely: Queſtionleſs they did ſo,
elſe they had not been <hi>Themſelves,</hi> that is, <hi>Righteous.</hi> And
for this Particular, by the Providence of God it is ſo come
to paſs, that we have repeated double aſſurance, and from
Chriſts own words again, what was their Righteouſneſs This
Way. Firſt, in his Perſonating a Proud Boaſter amongſt
them,<note place="margin">Luk. 18. 12.</note> that <hi>He paid Tythes of all he poſſeſſed.</hi> Which if He
had not, the ſuppoſition had been an untruth, the Man made
to ſpeak nothing to the purpoſe, Nor had he been brought in
truly Commending, but indeed Belying himſelf, That hee
ſhould have done that he did not. Next in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative
exprobration,<note place="margin">Matth. 23. 23.</note> where we have that Exactneſſe that
<hi>they Paid All</hi> to the leaſt, They left none out <hi>to very Mixt
Annis and Cummin,</hi> which our Saviour ſays, They Ought
(<hi>So it was their Righteouſneſs</hi>) to have done, and yet not have
left Juſtice and Mercy undone. So that no doubt can be but
they Paid, they paid duly, they paid of All, and this was
Their Righteouſneſs; and yet Chriſt to His Diſciples, unleſs
yours ſhall both Equall and Exceed <hi>Theirs and This,</hi> ye muſt
not look to come within my Kingdome. Nor let any one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
here Duty on their part, They were bound: True they
were ſo, but are we altogether Free? Have we not a Rule
of Righteouſneſs, in ſome ſort as ſtrictly binding as Theirs, to
make obedience <hi>duty,</hi> not performance <hi>Supererogation?</hi> and
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:58798:163"/>
we as well as they are required not to give but pay? What
elſe are thoſe Laws before alledged many, and yet of force?
Are they not All ſo many rules of Doing, or directing right
forward in what way we muſt go, or we go amiſs; and ſo
by conſequent our Conformity to them, our being Ruled by
them muſt bring home the imputation to us of Going right
forward or amiſs, in the way of Righteouſneſs or Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
that We may be Juſt or Unjuſt as they?</p>
               <p>We have no Levitical Law perhaps indeed, no <hi>Jus Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
(at leaſt not within my circle or which I inſiſt on, though
I forſake it not, much leſs diſclaim or oppoſe it:) But we
have yet without that enough of our own, and to binde faſt
enough, a Rule, a Law, Sacred, in force, and binding, as
hath been ſhewed, and whereto we ought to take heed as
that which in ſome regard was parallel with Saint <hi>Peters ſure
word of Propheſie,</hi> and is our light and rule to guide us through
the darkneſs and uncertainty of this world: the tranſgreſſion
whereof is alſo penall and with us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

liver is likewiſe a Sinner to God,) and it Muſt have
the imputation of Righteouſneſs or Unrighteouſneſs, as We
neglect or obſerve Here this Sacred, National, Engliſh Rule
of our Doings. Nought elſe is the ground of Property, of
Any property, that renders theft poſſible, or <hi>Wrong</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
to <hi>Right;</hi> This is the boundary of Fields and Vineyards,
cuts out to All their Lordſhips and Inheritances; and to obey
or diſobey, break or keep This, makes us as Culpable or Juſt,
Righteous or Unrighteous, as by obſerving or tranſgreſſing
his Judiciall Law the Hebrew could have been in Iſrael. No
queſtion but we have Law the Rule of Righteouſneſs, as bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to us as the Hebrews in their Politie; we may be as
Righteous as they, and yet if we be not more, we fall ſhort
of our High hopes; for <hi>verily</hi> (ſays Chriſt) <hi>unleſs your Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi>

hath inforced Tythes, ſome Statute Rampant in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of the Clergy, perhaps foiſted in by themſelves in the laſt
age; but now the truth is cleared up, the heavens ſhine, 'tis

               <p>Now my laſt appeal ſhould be <hi>ad Populum Chriſtianum,</hi>
from Severall Perſons, to whom hitherto, to the Body of the
People of this Nation; High and low, Rich and poor, One
with another,<note place="margin">Pſalm 49. 2.</note> as the Pſalm ſpeaketh, and All Together, for the
thing concerneth All: And my deſire tends to this, That they
would in the name and fear of God take heed what they doe,
and not be too forward to ſet their hands to that they may
beſhrew their fingers for all days of their lives after, in ſhaking
I mean or removing one Stone more out of the building to
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:58798:170"/>
leave the reſt looſe; or by unſetling <hi>Levi</hi>'s Parſonage houſe,
give ſuch example or beginning to ſhake all the reſt, that No
one ſhall for an age live ſecure, That His will not next year
fall down about his ears. Remember what before of, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued
All in one Veſſell, ſtanding All on One bough<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (Take
heed of cutting that) and Beware of touching that ſtring to
any violence that holds All we have together. Gentlemen
and Noblemen look to your ſelves, ye have (as now things are)
fair inheritances; God bleſs them to you, and you to them;
ye live in <hi>Canaan,</hi> Long may ye there live to ſerve God in
Chriſt in all <hi>worldly felicity:</hi> But take heed of venturing too
farr in untrodden pathes that have at leaſt ſhew of danger;
(the earth ſeems to ſhake under you already;) Be not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
to the unſetling <hi>Levi</hi>'s Portion in this good land the
Lord your God hath given him with you, which ſtands here
upon the ſame foundation of Law, (whether of God or Man)
that yours and others doe, For fear if you ſhould, what has
but the ſame ſupport may totter if not fall (with His) down
together: Be ſure there is Juſtice in heaven, and but too
likely means on earth to bring it to paſs, that if your hands
ſhould help to conveigh fire to one Corner of the thatch, It
may very ſoon it ſpread and run all over the houſe, beyond
the reach of ſtrength or power of policy and honeſt art to
ſuppreſs the flame, before it hath burned both you and yours,
your ſtately and magnificent ſumptuous Edifices. Your man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
are many, the Buildings great and fair, their Turrets
high, the Battlements ſtately and lifted up, diſperſed far and
wide over your rich and ample poſſeſſions: Long may you
enjoy them to comfort; But if you ſhould rejoyce in iniquity,
and not in the truth, furthering or permitting that ſpoil is of
the nature would ruine your ſelves and <hi>Your own;</hi> Take heed
the ſtroke reach not home to you too ſoon, leaving you
juſtly ere long neither houſe nor land, nor field, nor inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
And Good Chriſtian people All whatſoever, Be not
<hi>Ye</hi> wilfull to your own injury; Doe not ſtubbornly perſiſt in a
way may goe on to your inconceivable danger. If your
Tythingmans due be as your Own right, if his Glebe be as your
Freehold, and his Tenth from your land as your Nine in it,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:58798:170"/>
and the Land it ſelf; take heed how you meddle with the
common ſupport, the foundation and onely ſtay and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of both together: If his bee ſtirred, and yours
thereby looſe; if you take away his, and he put on for yours,
(as why may he not?) if you both thereby fall a ſcamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
thence a quarrelling, and ſo a fighting what can follow
hereon but very confuſion? A third may as well ſtrive for
both, and then what have you gained? If the fence <hi>of ſtrong
Law</hi> be not able to keep Him harmleſs now, How ſhould you
expect that the ſame armour ſhould defend you, and that
ſpoil and violence ſhould not break in to your diſturbance,
perhaps to lay All in Common, to which the breaking of ſome
incloſures, does more then declare, act and operate to make
way for. <hi>Let every one have his Own,</hi> and that is an eaſie and
obvious piece of Juſtice: I ſay again, <hi>Let every One have
his Own,</hi> and thats All I contend for, which ſhould give
offence, or ſhew of offence to None but thoſe that would have
that which is Other mens. That is His Own the Law makes
ſo, of which <hi>Levi</hi> having as Much as any other Tribe, He muſt
have thereby as much of Property, and thereby Right and
Safety, and Security (He ſhould:) and the troubling or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbing
him cannot in equity, and the nature of the Thing, but
doe that which if it ſhould be proſecuted by the ſame Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
muſt needs bring about, and redound conſequentially to
the diſturbance of all Iſrael. Juſtice is all I plead for, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Juſtice,
a low and ſordid Heatheniſh vertue not ſo much
in Chriſtianity, as I take under it, and thereby in it, as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
under it univerſally all ſorts of goodneſs: <hi>Suum cui<expan>

Chriſt being alſo and the Being and continuance of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel

have ſtirred a bodkin for any other; ſo he mutually hopes
They will defend Him; and by them, they are ſo publique,
returns that advantage which ere while was declined to have
againſt him, of publique intereſſe and ſtrength enough on his
ſide: For they never come in alone, but aſſiſting with the
moſt voices and votes, arms and armies of men in the world,
and if I have not them on my ſide, I diſclaim mine own
ingagement, and all my undertaking and performance, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.
For I ſhall always account it honeſt policy, whatever
in other matters, to ſtrive Here to be always on This ſtrongeſt

ſide, ſo farre that I profeſſe to remove and ſhift my ſails as
their appearance or advantage from them may occaſion, that
I may ſteer my courſe along with them conſtantly, nor will I
be of that party, (but rather forſake all, as near as I can my
ſelf) that ſhall in the leaſt degree give them or what they
would have, oppoſition. If any can ſhew I now am, I am not
only ready to withdraw, but ſhal at any time hereafter ſhew
my willingneſs to kiſs that hand ſhal gently endevor to lead me
from Errour to Truth, from Wrong to Right, Nay even love
that Sober violence that will not ſuffer me to plod on ſecurely
and without controll in an ill way, Though I ſhould be at
firſt a little drowſie or inapprehenſive; But for the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of malice and rage of fury, which uſes to doubly torment,
yet doe no good, wounding an adverſaries perhaps reputation,
perhaps patience, perhaps both, and through the ſides of
Truth too, and yet works no correction, nor eſtabliſheth any
thing in the room of what it deſtroys, I leave to that Juſtice
is wont to bring about <hi>in foveam quam fodêrunt,</hi> and that the
fire ſhall work onely upon that cole that bred it, but gently
warming whom it would, but could not burn. So does malice,
and <hi>So let it;</hi> onely eat into its Own bowels, and fury torment
the inraged in their own flames; for me, if any ſparks thereof
ſhould fly about, and touching me ſomewhat ſharply, prevail
to a temptation of return of the like, the worſt arrows of
Revenge I have preſently ready to retort are, Permiſſion,
Pity, Prayers, and Patience, being reſolved to entertain the

my death, and be mine to the end and in the end; and this

So I come ſafe and ſure Home, I will not ſhun to own miſtakes
